# Understanding Project Metrics

In this project, we closely monitored financial performance using [actual cost](../f2/page-t#actual-cost), [earned value](../f2/page-t#earned-value), and [cost variance](../f2/page-t#cost-variance). Each of these terms is critical to understanding how the project's budget is progressing relative to its plan.
