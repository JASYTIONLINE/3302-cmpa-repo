### Change & Configuration Control
Change control and configuration control are the mechanisms that keep a project stable while still allowing it to adapt. **Change control** refers to the structured process for reviewing, approving, or rejecting modifications to scope, schedule, cost, or quality. It ensures changes are logged, evaluated for impact, and only implemented with authorization from the change control board or project authority.  

**Configuration control** focuses on maintaining consistency of product performance and functional attributes with its requirements and design documentation. It ensures that the deliverable being built or maintained matches the approved specifications.  

Together, these controls protect the integrity of both the project’s management baselines and its outputs. This placeholder page confirms the link works and sets up space for deeper content. Future updates will expand with PMBOK 6 and PMBOK 7 comparisons, workflows, and examples showing how integrated change control operates across the life cycle.
