# Stakeholders & Team

PMBOK 7 emphasizes that project success depends heavily on **people**â€”both stakeholders and the project team. Stakeholders include anyone impacted by the project, from sponsors and customers to regulators and communities. Teams are the groups that do the work, requiring collaboration, trust, and clarity of purpose.  

This domain highlights that engagement is not a one-time event but an ongoing practice. Stakeholders must be identified, understood, and engaged to ensure their needs and expectations are aligned with value delivery. Teams, meanwhile, must be supported with clear roles, autonomy, and resources to perform effectively.  

For the exam, cues often point to whether a situation involves stakeholder alignment or team dynamics.  

This placeholder ensures the page is live. A full version will provide strategies for stakeholder analysis, examples of engagement practices, and exam tips for distinguishing between stakeholder and team-focused scenarios.
