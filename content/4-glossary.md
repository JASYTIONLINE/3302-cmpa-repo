### XP  

##### Definition  
An agile software development methodology that emphasizes frequent releases, continuous testing, pair programming, and close collaboration with customers to improve product quality and responsiveness to change.  
##### Context  
In PMP exam prep, XP is referenced as an example of an **Agile framework**.  
It is not a PMI standard but is included in the *Agile Practice Guide* as part of the range of agile approaches.  
Key practices include short development cycles, continuous integration, test-driven development, and pair programming.  
On the exam, XP may appear in questions contrasting predictive versus agile practices, especially where collaboration and iterative delivery are emphasized.  
##### Exam Cue  
On the exam, if a question mentions agile practices such as **pair programming**, **test-driven development**, or **frequent small releases**, the correct framework is XP (Extreme Programming).  
Do not confuse XP with Scrum (roles and ceremonies) or Kanban (workflow visualization).

In exam prep, its relevance is tied to **problem-solving, requirements analysis, and stakeholder communication**, where breaking down a system into behavior, structure, and interaction improves clarity.  

##### Exam Cue  
On the exam, if you see a reference to a diagram or technique that frames a problem in terms of **what it is, why it matters, and how it works**, this points to a Y-Chart or similar systems analysis tool.
