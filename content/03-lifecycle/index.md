## The Lifecycle of a Project – Home
 ![diagram of the Project lifecycle](lifecycle.jpg)]
 *A Project moves in a linear fashion, but the Phases can circle back on each other*
 
  ## The [[3-glossary#Project Management Lifecycle|Project Management Lifecycle]]
  The Project Management Lifecycle is the backbone of how projects move from concept to completion. It is organized into 5(+1) unique process groups: [[0-plan-prerequisites.md|Pre-Project Requirements]]; [[1-Initiating|Initiating Process Group]]; [[2-planning|Planning Process Group]]; [[3-executing|Executing Process Group]]; [[4-monitor-control|Monitoring and Controlling Process Group]]; and [[5-closing|Closing Process Group]].  

Each stage has its own focus, [[3-glossary#deliverable|deliverables]], and challenges, but together they form a structured flow that ensures a project stays aligned with objectives and value delivery.  This section explores how [The Project Management Body of Knowledge](https://www.pmi.org/standards/pmbok) identifies the [[#The 3-glossary#Project Management Lifecycle|Project Management Lifecycle]] and [[3-glossary#process|Project Management Processes]] as the backbone of how projects move from concept to completion.

By studying the lifecycle, we connect theory, case studies, [[3-glossary#Standards|standards,]] and [[01-test-prep/index.md|test preparation]] into a single framework. This helps ensure that knowledge is not memorized in isolation, but applied step by step, just as exam questions and real-world projects demand.
