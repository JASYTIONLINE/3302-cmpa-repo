## PMI Guide to the Lifecycle of a Project - Home
The Project Management Lifecycle is the backbone of how projects move from concept to completion. It is organized into five universal stages: [[03-lifecycle/01-initiating/index|Initiating]], [[03-lifecycle/02-planning/index|Planning]], [[03-lifecycle/03-executing/index|Executing]], [[03-lifecycle/04-monitoring-controlling/index|Monitoring & Controlling]], and [[03-lifecycle/05-closing/index|Closing]]. Each stage has its own focus, deliverables, and challenges, but together they form a structured flow that ensures a project stays aligned with objectives and value delivery.  

This section explores how [[02-pmbok/6-pmbok/index|PMBOK 6]]’s process-driven ITTO approach and [[02-pmbok/7-pmbok/index|PMBOK 7]]’s principle-based perspective both apply to the lifecycle. Learners will see how project work begins with authorization, develops into detailed plans, moves through execution, and adapts through monitoring before being formally closed. 

By studying the lifecycle, we connect theory, case studies, standards, and test preparation into a single framework. This helps ensure that knowledge is not memorized in isolation, but applied step by step, just as exam questions and real-world projects demand.
