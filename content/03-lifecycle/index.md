## PMI Guide to the Lifecycle of a Project – Home
The **Project Management Lifecycle** is the backbone of how projects move from concept to completion. See [[content/references|References]].  

It is organized into 5(+1) unique process groups: [[0-pre-project-requirments|Pre-Project Requirements]]; [[1-Initiating-process-group|Initiating Process Group]]; [[2-planning-process-group|Planning Process Group]]; [[3-executing-process-group|Executing Process Group]]; [[4-monitoring-and-controlling-process-group|Monitoring and Controlling Process Group]]; and [[5-closing-process-group|Closing Process Group]]. See [[content/references|References]].  

Each stage has its own focus, deliverables, and challenges, but together they form a structured flow that ensures a project stays aligned with objectives and value delivery. See [[content/references|References]].  

This section explores how [[02-pmbok-06/index|PMBOK 6]]’s process-driven ITTO approach and [[02-pmbok/7-pmbok/index|PMBOK 7]]’s principle-based perspective both apply to the lifecycle. See [[content/references|References]].  

By studying the lifecycle, we connect theory, case studies, standards, and test preparation into a single framework. This helps ensure that knowledge is not memorized in isolation, but applied step by step, just as exam questions and real-world projects demand. See [[content/references|References]].
