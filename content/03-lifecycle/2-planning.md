# 02 Planning The Plan

![[plan.jpg]]

The **Planning Process Group** establishes the roadmap for the project by transforming intent into a **workable plan**. In this group, the team defines scope, estimates effort and duration, sequences work, builds the schedule and budget, plans quality and communications, and identifies risks and responses. Planning is iterative and integrative: as new information emerges, the plan may be refined to keep the project aligned with objectives and constraints. See [[content/references|References]].  

Planning produces the **baselines** (scope, schedule, cost) that guide Executing and Monitoring & Controlling. These baselines are not just paperwork—they are **control references** that let the team measure performance, forecast outcomes, and make informed decisions when change is requested. See [[content/references|References]].

## Key Processes in the Planning Group

According to PMI, the Planning Process Group encompasses the following processes [[content/references|References]]:

1. **Plan Scope Management / Collect Requirements / Define Scope / Create WBS** — Clarify deliverables and decompose work.  
2. **Define Activities / Sequence Activities / Estimate Durations / Develop Schedule** — Build a realistic timeline.  
3. **Estimate Costs / Determine Budget** — Establish the cost baseline.  
4. **Plan Quality, Resources, Communications, Procurements** — Define how work will meet standards and how the team and vendors will collaborate.  
5. **Plan Risk Management / Identify Risks / Perform Qualitative & Quantitative Analysis / Plan Risk Responses** — Anticipate threats and opportunities.  
6. **Plan Stakeholder Engagement** — Set strategies for involvement and support.  

> *Planning turns what we want into what we will do—and how we will know if we are still on course.* — Adapted from PMI guidance, see [[content/references|References]]

## Baselines and Change Management

The outputs of Planning form the **Project Management Plan** and its **baselines**. During [[3-executing|Executing]], the team works to the plan; during [[4-monitor-control|Monitoring & Controlling]], performance is measured against baselines to detect variance. When warranted, changes are proposed and, if approved, baselines are **updated** deliberately—not drifted.  

This disciplined cycle preserves control while allowing for adaptive learning. Adapted from PMI process guidance, see [[content/references|References]].

## Example in Practice

Every **Monday** is a new project in CMPA. The week begins with a [[0-plan-prerequisites.md|pre-project]] mini-phase where the **Week Overview** is reviewed. This acts as the **customer request** and the basis for a lightweight **charter**.  

Then [[2-planning|planning]] starts: the **To-Do list** becomes a rough **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**, assignment **deadlines** shape the schedule and workflow, and the **rubric** defines what success looks like (acceptance criteria).  

With scope clarified, tasks decomposed, and timeboxes visible, the plan keeps the week pointed in the right direction and helps prevent scope creep, missed deadlines, and blown budgets.

*Planning builds the baselines and management plans that guide execution and enable effective control. When the planning phase closes, the plan is handed off to the project manager in charge of executing the plan.*
