# Initiating Process Group

The **Initiating Process Group** is the collection of processes performed to formally start a new project or a new phase of an existing project. It ensures that a project’s purpose is clearly defined, that authorization is granted, and that the project manager has the authority to apply organizational resources.  

Unlike the *initiation phase*, which is a time-boxed stage, the **Initiating Process Group** is a recurring set of processes. Every phase of a project may begin with activities from this group to validate objectives, realign stakeholder expectations, and reconfirm business value.

## Key Processes in the Initiating Group

1. **Develop Project Charter** – Authorizes the project and names the project manager.  
2. **Identify Stakeholders** – Documents who is affected, their interests, and their influence on the project.  

> *“The purpose of the Initiating Process Group is to align stakeholders’ expectations with the project’s purpose, give them visibility about the scope and objectives, and show how their participation can help achieve those expectations.”* — PMBOK® Guide, 6th Ed.

## Example in Practice

A software project may begin with a **charter signed by the CIO**, authorizing the project manager to begin. At the same time, stakeholders are identified — executives, end users, IT staff, and vendors. By capturing this list early, the project team can plan effective communication strategies in the next process group, Planning.
