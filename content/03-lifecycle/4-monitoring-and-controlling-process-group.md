# Monitoring & Controlling Process Group

Monitoring & Controlling keeps a project anchored to reality. You compare what actually happened against the [[2-planning-process-group|plans]] (scope, schedule, cost, plus quality, resources, risk), spot variances early, and make deliberate adjustments so the work stays aligned with the objectives—never by accidental drift [[references|PMBOK2017]].

This discipline runs continuously alongside every other group: [[3-executing-process-group|Executing]] produces data; Monitoring interprets it; and Controlling applies decisions The central questions are simple but relentless: *Where are we? Why are we here? What should we do about it?* [[references|Kogon2024]].

*Monitoring & Controlling measures performance against baselines and applies change control to steer outcomes toward objectives [[references|PMBOK2017]].
## What this looks like in practice

- Track real performance against baselines and call out green/yellow/red health so everyone sees risks in time to act [[references|PMBOK2017]].
- Use a simple, truthful status report to surface issues and ask for help or decisions [[references|Kogon2024]].
- When change is proposed (or required), analyze the impact across time, cost, scope, quality, resources, and risk; then route a formal change for a decision and update the baseline if approved [[references|PMBOK2017]].
- Keep stakeholders informed with concise, timely updates—the good, the bad, and the fix [[references|Kogon2024]].

## Monitoring vs. Controlling

Monitoring is ongoing measurement and analysis. You observe results, compare them to baselines and thresholds, and surface variances early so options remain open. Monitoring answers: *Where are we vs. plan? What’s trending? What risks are emerging?* [[references|PMBOK2017]].

Monitoring is *diagnosis*. It asks: *Where are we compared to the plan? What trends are forming? What risks are emerging?* The foundation comes from the [[project-management-plan]], [[project-documents]], [[work-performance-data]], [[agreements]], [[eefs]], and [[opas]]. [[references|PMBOK2017]].

Controlling is *treatment*. It answers: *What will we change, who approves it, and how do we realign?* It depends on [[work-performance-information]] analyzed against the baselines and the decisions formalized through [[perform-integrated-change-control]] [[references|PMBOK2017]].

Monitoring can continue even when no action is needed whereas controlling begins the moment a decision or adjustment is required [[references|Kogon2024]].

### Monitoring — ITTOs

**Inputs**
- [[project-management-plan]] (scope, schedule, cost baselines; quality, resource, communications, risk, procurement, stakeholder plans)  
- [[project-documents]] (assumption/issue/change logs; requirements & traceability; risk register; lessons learned; schedule & cost forecasts)  
- [[work-performance-data]] (actuals from [[3-executing-process-group|Executing]])  
- [[agreements]], [[eefs]], [[opas]]  

**Tools & Techniques**
- [[data-analysis]]: variance/trend analysis, [[evm]], forecasting (e.g., [[eac]]), root-cause analysis, reserve analysis  
- [[data-representation]]: dashboards, burn/control charts  
- [[decision-methods]]: expert judgment, multi-criteria analysis; [[meetings]]  
- [[pmis-and-reporting-systems]]; [[risk-reassessment-and-audits]]; stakeholder/communications feedback loops  

**Outputs**
- [[work-performance-reports]] (tailored, decision-ready)  
- [[change-requests]] (corrective/preventive/defect repair)  
- [[updates]]: [[project-management-plan]], [[project-documents]], [[opas]], and stakeholder communications

---

**Controlling.** Decision and adjustment. You choose corrective or preventive actions, route changes for approval, update baselines when needed, and communicate decisions. Controlling answers: *What will we change, who approves it, and how do we keep alignment?* [[references|PMBOK2017]].

### Controlling — ITTOs

**Inputs**
- [[project-management-plan]] (baselines and subsidiary plans for [[quality]], [[resources]], [[risk]], [[communications]], [[procurements]], [[stakeholders]])  
- [[project-documents]] ([[issue-logs]]/[[change-logs]], [[requirements-traceability]], [[quality-reports]], [[risk-register]], [[lessons-learned]], [[procurement-records]])  
- [[work-performance-information]] (analyzed actuals from [[monitoring-and-controlling-process-group|Monitoring]])  
- [[agreements]], [[eefs]], [[opas]]  

**Tools & Techniques**
- [[data-analysis]]: variance and trend, [[what-if-scenarios]], [[evm]]  
- [[decision-methods-and-governance]]: expert judgment, multi-criteria analysis, [[change-control-boards]]  
- [[measurement-and-review]]: [[inspections]], [[audits]], [[control-charts]], [[burn-charts]], [[checklists]], [[sampling]]  
- [[systems-and-collaboration]]: [[pmis-and-reporting-systems|PMIS dashboards]], [[facilitated-workshops]], [[negotiation]]/[[claims-administration]]  

**Outputs**
- [[change-requests]] routed through [[perform-integrated-change-control|integrated change control]]  
- [[approved-changes]] and updated [[baselines]]/[[plans]]  
- [[work-performance-reports]] with [[control-measurements]]  
- Updated [[project-documents]] and [[procurement-records]]  
- [[deliverable-status-artifacts]] (verified or accepted deliverables)

## Shared ITTOs — The Loop

Monitoring and Controlling share the same cycle [[references|PMBOK2017]].

- The *project management plan* provides baselines and is updated when approved changes occur.  
- *Project documents* both inform monitoring and record controlling decisions.  
- *Work performance data* becomes *information*, then *reports*. Reports may trigger *change requests*.  
- Approved changes update the plan and documents, which form the truth for the next monitoring cycle.  

---
## Key Processes

The processes in this group stabilize a project [[references|PMBOK2017]].

- [[monitor-and-control-project-work]] tracks progress against the plan.  
- [[perform-integrated-change-control]] governs decisions.  
- [[validate-scope]] and [[control-scope]] confirm requirements and prevent creep.  
- [[control-schedule]] and [[control-costs]] forecast schedule and budget variances.  
- [[control-quality]] checks standards.  
- [[control-resources]] verifies resource use.  
- [[monitor-communications]] ensures information flow.  
- [[monitor-risks]] reviews risk triggers and responses.  
- [[control-procurements]] ensures vendor alignment.  
- [[monitor-stakeholder-engagement]] assesses stakeholder support.

## Variance Management

Variance is where theory meets reality [[references|PMBOK2017]].The cycle asks four questions:  

1. *Detect and diagnose* — What changed, and why? [[references|Kogon2024]]  
2. *Choose a response* — Correct, prevent, or accept the variance? [[references|PMBOK2017]].  
3. *Decide the change* — Does this require a request? Who approves? How do we update the baseline? [[references|PMBOK2017]].
4. *Communicate* — Who needs to know, and when? [[references|Kogon2024]]  

> Control is not about saying *no*. It is about making informed decisions that balance constraints and keep the project focused [[references|PMBOK2017]].

## Example in Practice: City of Winnipeg

The City of Winnipeg’s Project Management Manual illustrates Monitoring & Controlling through municipal infrastructure projects. Executing produces deliverables such as roadway segments, utility relocations, or facility upgrades. Monitoring asks: *Are the deliverables being built to scope and schedule baselines? Do cost reports align with the approved budget? Are quality tests and inspections meeting specifications?* [[references|City of Winnipeg, 2021]]

When a variance appears — for example, a contractor delay, an unexpected soil condition, or a cost overrun on materials — it is flagged through regular status reporting. Controlling then asks: *What action realigns this work? Do we issue a corrective work order, approve a preventive scope adjustment, or raise a formal change request for additional funds or time?* Each action is logged, routed through integrated change control, and incorporated into updated baselines. By project closeout, deliverables are verified, accepted, and documented in alignment with the city’s standards, providing both accountability and lessons learned for future projects [[references|City of Winnipeg, 2021]]
