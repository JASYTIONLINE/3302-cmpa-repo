# Closing Process Group

The **Closing Process Group** formally completes the project or a phase and transfers the final product, service, or result to operations or the requesting organization. Closing confirms that work has been completed to requirements, secures formal **acceptance**, and releases resources. It is also where the team consolidates **lessons learned** and archives project information for audit, knowledge reuse, and organizational learning.  

Closing is not a “nice-to-have.” Without it, teams can drift from one effort to the next with no clear handoff, open contracts, unresolved documentation, and missed opportunities to improve. A disciplined closeout provides clarity for stakeholders, financial accuracy for the organization, and actionable insights for future projects.

## Key Processes in the Closing Group

1. **Confirm Final Acceptance** — Obtain formal sign-off from the authorized customer/sponsor.  
2. **Close Project or Phase** — Complete financials, archive documents, update assets, and release resources.  
3. **Close Procurements** — Verify all contracts are completed, deliverables accepted, and obligations met.  
4. **Capture and Share Lessons Learned** — Document what worked, what didn’t, and recommendations for the future.  

> Closing turns deliverables into **accepted value**, and experience into **organizational knowledge**.

## Acceptance, Handover, and Learning

Successful Closing requires **clear acceptance criteria**—defined in Planning and verified during Executing and Monitoring & Controlling. Handover to operations (or the customer) should be planned, with training, access, and support arrangements documented. Lessons learned should be gathered from the entire stakeholder set, not just the core team, and stored where they can be discovered and reused by others.

### Example in Practice

A logistics optimization project delivers its final routing engine. The sponsor signs the **final acceptance** after UAT criteria are met. Contracts are closed; vendor warranties are logged; the knowledge base and runbooks are handed to operations. In the retrospective, the team documents improvements to data onboarding and stakeholder review cadence. Artifacts are archived and the team is formally **released**—free to take on the next assignment.
