# Executing Process Group

The **Executing Process Group** is where the plan becomes action and action becomes **deliverables**. In this group, the project manager and team coordinate people, resources, vendors, and communications to perform the work defined in the project management plan. Executing is also where leadership and stakeholder engagement matter most: progress depends on clear direction, timely decisions, and removing roadblocks so the team can do its best work.  

While Planning defines *what* needs to be done and *how*, Executing focuses on **doing the work**, **managing performance**, and **maintaining alignment** with the baselines established in Planning. Issues discovered here are communicated and, when necessary, routed back through Monitoring & Controlling to request changes or corrective actions.

## Key Processes in the Executing Group

1. **Direct and Manage Project Work** — Perform the work to produce deliverables.  
2. **Manage Quality** — Apply planned quality activities to verify processes and prevent defects.  
3. **Acquire, Develop, and Manage Team** — Build capability, resolve conflicts, and maintain performance.  
4. **Manage Communications** — Ensure the right information reaches the right stakeholders at the right time.  
5. **Manage Stakeholder Engagement** — Maintain buy-in, address concerns, and sustain support.  
6. **Manage Procurements** (when applicable) — Work with vendors to deliver contracted scope.  

> Execution turns plans into **deliverables**; leadership, communication, and stakeholder engagement turn deliverables into **value**.

## Managing Teams and Communications

Executing is a **people-centric** process group. The project manager enables performance by clarifying expectations, protecting the team’s focus, and escalating blockers early. Communications are proactive and purposeful: status, decisions, risks, and changes are routed to the correct audiences through agreed channels and cadences. Quality is built in—not just inspected at the end—by following defined processes and using feedback loops to prevent defects and rework.

### Example in Practice

A healthcare analytics project begins data integration work during Executing. The team follows the plan’s sprint cadence, completes incremental data mappings, and demonstrates outputs to key stakeholders every two weeks. A data source changes mid-stream; the issue is surfaced in the daily stand-up, a change request is raised through Monitoring & Controlling, and the plan is adjusted without derailing scope or timeline. Deliverables keep flowing because team, quality, and communications practices are working together.
