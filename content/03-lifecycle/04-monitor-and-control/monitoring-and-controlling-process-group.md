# Monitoring & Controlling Process Group

The **Monitoring & Controlling Process Group** compares actual performance to the **baselines** established in Planning (scope, schedule, and cost) to detect variances early and steer the project back on track. It ensures that the right work is being done, to the right quality, at the right time and cost. This group also evaluates change requests, approves or rejects them through the appropriate authority, and updates plans and baselines **deliberately**—not accidentally.

Monitoring & Controlling is continuous and cross-cutting: it interacts with **every other process group**. Data from Executing is measured against the plan; when impacts are identified, the team uses the **integrated change control** process to evaluate options, decide, and communicate outcomes. Proactive risk monitoring and response keep threats in check and help capture opportunities.

## Key Processes in the Monitoring & Controlling Group

1. **Monitor and Control Project Work** — Track, review, and report performance.  
2. **Perform Integrated Change Control** — Evaluate, approve, or reject change requests and update baselines when needed.  
3. **Validate Scope / Control Scope** — Confirm deliverables meet requirements and prevent scope creep.  
4. **Control Schedule / Control Costs** — Manage variances and forecast outcomes (EVM, trend analysis).  
5. **Monitor Risks / Implement Risk Responses** — Watch triggers, execute responses, and recalibrate as needed.  
6. **Monitor Communications, Quality, Resources, and Stakeholder Engagement** — Ensure plans are followed and effective.  

> Control is not about saying “no”—it’s about making **informed decisions** that keep the project aligned with objectives.

## Variance, Change, and Communication

When variance is detected, the team analyzes root causes and considers options: corrective action, preventive action, or accepting the variance with rationale. Approved changes are incorporated through **formal updates** to the plan and baselines; status and decisions are communicated to the right stakeholders with clarity and timeliness. This discipline prevents silent scope creep and preserves trust.

### Example in Practice

During development, a regulatory update adds a reporting field. The team logs a **change request**, analyzes schedule and cost impacts, and the CCB approves the change with a minor slip in schedule. The plan and baselines are updated; communications are sent to sponsors and end users; downstream tasks are resequenced. By following integrated change control, the project stays transparent and in control.
