# Planning Process Group

The **Planning Process Group** establishes the roadmap for the project by transforming intent into a **workable plan**. In this group, the team defines scope, estimates effort and duration, sequences work, builds the schedule and budget, plans quality and communications, and identifies risks and responses. Planning is iterative and integrative: as new information emerges, the plan may be refined to keep the project aligned with objectives and constraints.

Planning produces the **baselines** (scope, schedule, cost) that guide Executing and Monitoring & Controlling. These baselines are not just paperwork—they are **control references** that let the team measure performance, forecast outcomes, and make informed decisions when change is requested.

## Key Processes in the Planning Group

1. **Plan Scope Management / Collect Requirements / Define Scope / Create WBS** — Clarify deliverables and decompose work.  
2. **Define Activities / Sequence Activities / Estimate Durations / Develop Schedule** — Build a realistic timeline.  
3. **Estimate Costs / Determine Budget** — Establish the cost baseline.  
4. **Plan Quality, Resources, Communications, Procurements** — Define how work will meet standards and how the team and vendors will collaborate.  
5. **Plan Risk Management / Identify Risks / Perform Qualitative & Quantitative Analysis / Plan Risk Responses** — Anticipate threats and opportunities.  
6. **Plan Stakeholder Engagement** — Set strategies for involvement and support.  

> Planning turns *what we want* into *what we will do*—and how we will know if we are still on course.

## Baselines and Change Management

The outputs of Planning form the **Project Management Plan** and its **baselines**. During Executing, the team works to the plan; during Monitoring & Controlling, performance is measured against baselines to detect variance. When warranted, changes are proposed and, if approved, baselines are **updated** deliberately—not drifted. This disciplined cycle preserves control while allowing for adaptive learning.

### Example in Practice

A data platform project defines scope through a WBS (data ingestion, modeling, dashboards). Activities are sequenced, durations estimated, and a three-release schedule is developed. Costs are estimated by team capacity and tooling; the budget is approved with contingency for risk. Communications and stakeholder plans set cadence and audiences. When a new compliance requirement emerges, a change request is raised, impacts are analyzed, and—if approved—the plan and baselines are updated without losing overall control.
