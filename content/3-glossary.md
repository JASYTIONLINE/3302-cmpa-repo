### Actual Cost  
#### AC  

##### Definition  
The total expenditure incurred for completed project work during a specific time period, including labor, materials, equipment, and overhead.  

##### Context  
In PMI’s earned value management framework, [AC](#ac) is one of the three core data points, along with [EV](#ev) and [PV](#pv).  
It reflects the **money already spent**, drawn directly from financial records.  
AC is essential for interpreting performance indicators like [CPI](#cpi) and [EAC](#eac).  
On the exam, questions will test whether you can distinguish AC (actual spending) from EV (value earned) and PV (planned progress).  

##### Exam Cue  
On the exam, [AC](#ac) is tested as the metric that answers: *“How much has been spent so far?”*  
It is always based on actual expenditures, not on planned or projected values.  
Do not confuse it with [PV](#pv), which is planned work, or [EV](#ev), which is earned progress.  

### Agile Practice Guide
Definition:

A foundational reference guide co-developed by the Project Management Institute (PMI) and Agile Alliance that outlines agile values, principles, and common practices across multiple agile methodologies.
##### Why you should use it:

The Agile Practice Guide is essential for PMP exam prep because the exam includes a significant focus on agile and hybrid approaches. It bridges the gap between traditional and agile project management, helping candidates understand when and how to apply agile principles. It's especially helpful for scenario-based questions on servant leadership, adaptive planning, and iterative delivery. PMI frequently pulls content from this guide on the exam.

### Backlog  
**Definition.** A backlog is an ordered list of work items  
that represent future value to be delivered by the project or team.  
Backlogs are dynamic, evolving artifacts used in adaptive environments,  
often prioritized by customer value, risk, and learning.

> **Exam cue.** Backlogs are used in adaptive/hybrid life cycles.  
They are not frozen scope documents—they flex as feedback is received.  
Don’t treat the backlog like a predictive WBS or scope baseline.  
Near-term items are detailed, long-term items stay light until refined.

### Cause And Effect Diagram  
**Definition.** A cause-and-effect diagram, also known as a fishbone or Ishikawa diagram,  
is a visual tool used to identify and group possible root causes of a problem.  
It helps categorize factors like materials, methods, people, and environment  
to support root cause analysis and quality improvement.

> **Exam cue.** Use this in **Control Quality** or **Manage Quality** questions  
that involve identifying why a defect or issue occurred.  
It does not solve the problem—it frames it for investigation.

### Daily Stand Up  
**Definition.** A daily stand-up is a brief, timeboxed team meeting  
used to synchronize work, surface blockers, and foster transparency.  
Common in Agile, it’s held at the same time and place each day.

> **Exam cue.** If the question asks about daily team coordination,  
quick feedback loops, or surfacing blockers, this is the go-to answer.  
Often confused with status meetings—PMI prefers lightweight, team-led sessions.

### Identify Stakeholders  
**Definition.** Identify stakeholders is the process of determining  
who will be affected by the project, their interests, influence,  
and potential impact—both positive and negative.

> **Exam cue.** This is one of the first processes in initiating.  
Use it when the question involves mapping influence, interests, or engagement levels.  
Also linked to stakeholder analysis and register creation.

### Issue Log  

#### Definition  
A project document used to record and track issues that require resolution. Each entry typically includes the issue description, owner, priority, status, and target resolution date.  
#### Context  
In PMI’s framework, an issue log is created during the **Manage Project Team** or **Direct and Manage Project Work** processes and is maintained throughout the project.  
Unlike a [risk register](#risk-register), which documents uncertain events, the issue log tracks **problems that have already occurred** and must be addressed.  
On the exam, recognizing the difference between **potential risks** (future, uncertain) and **issues** (present, real) is critical.  
#### Exam Cue  
On the exam, the [issue log](#issue-log) appears when the project manager must document and monitor an existing problem and assign responsibility for resolution.  
Do not confuse this with the [risk register](#risk-register), which deals with uncertain future events.  
### Sample Question 1  
A team member reports that a critical supplier has already missed two deliveries, delaying work on a major component. What should the project manager do first?  

**Answer Choices (with why)**  

- **A. Update the risk register with the supplier problem.**  
  ❌ Wrong. The risk register is for potential future events, not current problems.  
  **Why:** This is not a risk; it is an issue that has already occurred.  

- **B. Document the situation in the issue log and assign an owner.**  
  ✅ Correct. The supplier delay is an active problem, so it must be logged and tracked in the issue log.  
  **Why:** PMI expects the issue log to be the formal tool for monitoring and resolving existing issues.  

- **C. Escalate the problem immediately to the project sponsor.**  
  ❌ Wrong. Escalation may be necessary later, but the first step is to log and assign the issue for tracking.  
  **Why:** Proper process is to capture and manage the issue before escalating.  

- **D. Add a new risk response to account for supplier delays.**  
  ❌ Wrong. A response plan belongs in the risk register for uncertain future risks, not current issues.  
  **Why:** This event has already happened and must be managed as an issue.

### Job Hazard/Safety Analysis
#### H&S  
**Definition.** A job hazard/safety analysis identifies health and safety risks  
associated with specific tasks and documents mitigation steps to reduce harm.  
It is often required in regulated industries or government environments.

> **Exam cue.** If the scenario involves physical labor, environmental risks,  
or safety protocols—this term applies.  
It links to compliance, quality, and risk management.

### Near-Critical Path  
**Definition.** Near-critical paths are network paths  
that have **low float** and could become critical if delayed.  
They require close monitoring even if they’re not currently critical.

> **Exam cue.** If the question mentions activities with small slack  
or risk of becoming critical, this is the concept.  
Look for float between 1–5 days.

### Q
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Qualitative Risk Analysis  
**Definition.** Qualitative risk analysis prioritizes identified risks  
by assessing their **probability** and **impact**, and documenting their urgency, ownership, and categorization.  
It’s a fast, judgment-based technique used before investing in deeper (quantitative) analysis.

> **Exam cue.** If the exam asks how to assess risk quickly or without data-heavy models, this is your go-to.  
Expect terms like “risk rating,” “P-I matrix,” “heat map,” or “urgency.”  
This analysis guides which risks get monitored closely or escalated.  
PMI ties it directly to stakeholder risk perception, which may vary across teams.

### RACI  
**Definition.** RACI is a type of responsibility assignment matrix  
that clarifies roles by labeling each participant as **Responsible**, **Accountable**,  
**Consulted**, or **Informed** for each activity or deliverable.

> **Exam cue.** If the question asks how to resolve **role confusion**,  
or how to ensure everyone knows their job, RACI is your answer.  
“Responsible” = does the work,  
“Accountable” = owns the result,  
“Consulted” = gives input,  
“Informed” = kept in the loop.  
RACI appears in **resource management**, stakeholder alignment, and communication planning.

### Salience Model  
**Definition.** The salience model categorizes stakeholders  
based on **power**, **urgency**, and **legitimacy** to determine  
how much attention they should receive from the project team.

> **Exam cue.** Use this when the exam asks how to **prioritize stakeholders**,  
especially when you have limited time or conflicting needs.  
If someone has all three attributes, they’re a **definitive stakeholder** and must be engaged closely.  
Common in stakeholder analysis and strategy planning.

### SD  

##### Definition  
Development that meets present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, achieved by balancing economic growth, environmental protection, and social responsibility.  

##### Context  
In the PMP framework, [SD](#sd) connects directly to **PMI’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct** and the **ECO’s Business Environment domain**.  
It emphasizes that projects should create value not only for immediate stakeholders but also for society and the environment over the long term.  
On the exam, it may be contrasted with purely financial success metrics, reminding candidates that project outcomes must consider environmental and social impacts alongside cost and schedule.  

##### Exam Cue  
On the exam, [SD](#sd) is tested as the principle of ensuring projects deliver long-term value while minimizing harm to people and the environment.  
If a question asks about balancing profit, social benefit, and environmental impact, the correct perspective is sustainable development.  

#### Sample Question   
A project team is pressured to cut costs by using cheaper materials. This option would meet budget goals but would increase environmental waste and reduce the community’s trust in the organization.  
What should the project manager do?  

**Answer Choices (with why)**  

- **A. Approve the cheaper materials to satisfy the budget.**  
  ❌ Wrong. Short-term cost savings do not align with sustainability goals and can damage reputation.  
  **Why:** PMP standards require consideration of long-term social and environmental impacts.  

- **B. Escalate the decision to the sponsor for financial approval.**  
  ❌ Wrong. Escalation ignores the project manager’s duty to advocate for sustainable practices.  
  **Why:** PMI expects project managers to incorporate ethics and sustainability into decisions.  

- **C. Recommend an option that meets requirements while considering environmental and social impacts.**  
  ✅ Correct. Sustainable development means balancing cost, environmental, and social concerns.  
  **Why:** This aligns with PMI’s business environment focus and sustainable value delivery.  

- **D. Delay the decision until after the next phase gate review.**  
  ❌ Wrong. Deferring the issue avoids responsibility and can lead to poor outcomes.  
  **Why:** Proactive decision-making is required to align with sustainability principles.

### T&M Contract  
#### Time and Materials  
**Definition.** A T&M contract pays the seller based on **actual time worked and materials used**.  
It’s flexible for scope changes and is a mix between fixed price and cost reimbursable models.

> **Exam cue.** Choose this when scope is unclear or Agile work is being done.  
Often used for consultants, iterations, or phased work.  
May require a **Not-to-Exceed clause** to control costs.

### UAT Criteria  
**Definition.** UAT criteria are the **specific, testable conditions**  
that must be met during **User Acceptance Testing** to confirm that a product or service  
is ready for release. They translate acceptance criteria into user-focused validation checks.

> **Exam cue.** Use this when the exam asks, “What tells the customer it’s ready?”  
These criteria are defined early (often during planning)  
and guide final testing, sign-off, and handover.  
If UAT fails, these are the checkpoints that weren’t met.

### V
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Validate Scope  
**Definition.** Validate Scope is the process of **formally accepting completed deliverables**.  
It’s performed by the customer or sponsor—not the project team—and typically follows internal quality checks.

> **Exam cue.** If the exam asks “how do we know the work is acceptable to the customer?”—this is your answer.  
It’s not technical verification (that’s Quality Control), it’s business validation.  
Expect this in scope management, customer satisfaction, or project closure questions.

### WBS Dictionary  
**Definition.** The WBS Dictionary provides **detailed descriptions**  
of WBS elements—such as scope, deliverables, milestones, cost estimates, and owners.  
It complements the WBS and brings clarity to each component.

> **Exam cue.** If the question says “where is the detailed description of this work?”—this is it.  
The WBS itself is just a structure—the dictionary is the definition.  
Expect it to show up in scope clarification and contract terms.

### Y
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Y-axis  
**(Impact in P–I matrix)**  
**Definition.** In a Probability–Impact (P–I) matrix,  
the Y-axis represents **impact**—how severely a risk would affect the project if it occurs.  
Impact is usually ranked from low to high.

> **Exam cue.** When the exam describes a risk matrix or asks about risk prioritization,  
know that **impact = Y-axis** and **probability = X-axis**.  
The matrix helps visualize which risks need action.

### Z
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Zero float  
**(critical path)**  
**Definition.** Zero float means an activity has **no allowable delay**  
without impacting the project’s finish date.  
These tasks lie directly on the **critical path**.

> **Exam cue.** If the question asks which tasks will delay the project  
if late by even one day—this is it.  
Zero float = no room for slippage.  
Often tested in schedule compression and risk analysis questions.
