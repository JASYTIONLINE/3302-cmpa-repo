## Executing Process Group – Where the Work Gets Real

Executing is where all the planning finally gets to stretch its legs. The processes in this group exist to **coordinate people, manage [[3-glossary#delivery|Delivery]], and keep things moving**. The ITTOs you’ll find here aren’t abstract or theoretical — they’re **tactical**, **practical**, and deeply **human**.

This process group is where schedules meet reality, stakeholders start watching closely, and issues surface faster than [[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] registers can keep up. But the ITTOs in Executing are ready for this. They're about **guiding the team**, **communicating across boundaries**, and **making mid-[[3-glossary#flight|Flight]] decisions** that still align with the original charter.

Each process below serves as a *container* for ITTOs that help translate intent into outcomes. We won’t walk through the process mechanics — just the ITTOs they hold, and why they matter when the real work begins.

## Direct and Manage Project Work

This is the central engine of execution. It’s the process where the plan turns into deliverables — the actual doing of the work.

Inputs here include everything you’d expect: the [[3-glossary#project management plan|Project management plan]], approved [[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]], EEFs, OPAs, and [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] data. What makes this process powerful is its toolset: expert judgment, [[3-glossary#meetings|Meetings]], project management information systems (PMIS), and [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#issue|Issue]] management|[[3-glossary#issue|Issue]] management]].

Outputs are what you’d hope for — **deliverables**, **work [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] data**, and new **[[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]]**. But the real story is that every input in this process can be dynamic. Plans shift. Issues emerge. The PM’s job is to keep action aligned with intent — even when things are messy.

This process produces the **raw materials** for monitoring and controlling. If it’s not logged or communicated here, it probably doesn’t exist.

## Manage Project Knowledge

While Direct and Manage is about [[3-glossary#delivery|Delivery]], Manage Project Knowledge is about **learning while delivering**. The ITTOs here [[3-glossary#support|Support]] creating and sharing knowledge in real time — especially lessons that future teams can reuse.

Inputs include the project team’s experience, deliverables in progress, and organizational knowledge bases. Techniques like knowledge management, information-sharing tools, and [[3-glossary#feedback|Feedback]] systems help capture insights before they vanish into [[3-glossary#slack|Slack]] threads and hallway conversations.

The key output — **[[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#lessons learned|Lessons learned]] register|[[3-glossary#lessons learned|Lessons learned]] register]]** — isn’t just an after-action [[3-glossary#artifact|Artifact]]. It lives during execution. It helps shape better outcomes as you go, not just when you look back.

## Acquire, Develop, and Manage Team

These three processes are the **people operations** heart of Executing. Planning told you who you'd need. Now you go get them, grow them, and lead them.

In **Acquire [[3-glossary#resources|Resources]]**, inputs include resource calendars, [[3-glossary#availability|Availability]], and organizational [[3-glossary#policies|Policies]]. Outputs include assigned [[3-glossary#resources|Resources]] and physical assets. Tools include [[3-glossary#negotiation|Negotiation]], internal hiring systems, and procurement interfaces.

**Develop Team** uses [[3-glossary#coaching|Coaching]], [[3-glossary#training|Training]], [[3-glossary#feedback|Feedback]], and team-building activities to move the group from a collection of names into a functioning unit. Outputs include [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] assessments, skill improvements, and strengthened team [[3-glossary#cohesion|Cohesion]].

Finally, **Manage Team** handles ongoing [[3-glossary#engagement|Engagement]], [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#conflict|Conflict]] [[3-glossary#resolution|Resolution]]|[[3-glossary#conflict|Conflict]] [[3-glossary#resolution|Resolution]]]], [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] tracking, and [[3-glossary#adaptation|Adaptation]]. It’s where [[3-glossary#emotional intelligence|Emotional intelligence]] meets organizational policy — and where many projects either thrive or unravel.

Across all three, the ITTOs [[3-glossary#lean|Lean]] heavily on interpersonal skills, [[3-glossary#communication|Communication]] tools, and real-time [[3-glossary#feedback|Feedback]] loops. These processes keep the humans aligned while the work accelerates.

## Manage Communications

If you're managing work and people, you'd better be managing [[3-glossary#communication|Communication]]. This process ensures that the right people get the right information, in the right format, at the right time.

The inputs are wide-ranging — from project plans to [[3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] registers to actual [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] data. Techniques include [[3-glossary#communication|Communication]] models, [[3-glossary#information distribution|Information distribution]] systems, and [[3-glossary#active listening|Active listening]] (yes, that’s an ITTO-adjacent concept). [[3-glossary#meetings|Meetings]], status updates, dashboards, and impromptu syncs all live here.

The output? Information that flows — not just exists. If your comms are delayed, misunderstood, or overly complex, this is the process that helps untangle it.

## Implement [[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] Responses

You planned for [[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] earlier. This is where those plans get triggered. Implement [[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] Responses connects planning to action — it’s the moment where a [[3-glossary#mitigation|Mitigation]] or [[3-glossary#contingency|Contingency]] plan stops being hypothetical.

Inputs include the [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] register|[[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] register]], [[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] response plan, and [[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]]. Execution tools include expert judgment, PMIS, and interpersonal skills (because not every [[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] response lands gently).

Outputs are clear: work [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] data, [[3-glossary#issue|Issue]] logs, and updates to documents reflecting how [[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] response played out in real time.

This is where proactive work becomes reactive [[3-glossary#readiness|Readiness]] — and where the exam often tests your ability to recognize **intentional** vs. **improvised** responses.

## Conduct Procurements

Working with vendors isn’t just about [[3-glossary#contracts|Contracts]] — it’s about managing relationships, timelines, and [[3-glossary#expectations|Expectations]] once the work begins. This process activates procurement agreements, oversees deliverables, and navigates issues or claims.

Inputs include bid documents, selected sellers, and agreements. Tools may include [[3-glossary#negotiation|Negotiation]], [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] reviews|[[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] reviews]], inspections, and claims administration systems.

Key outputs include **procurement [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] [[3-glossary#reports|Reports]]**, **updates to agreements**, and occasionally **[[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]]** if [[3-glossary#scope|Scope]], price, or timelines shift.

Effective execution here means staying ahead of [[3-glossary#vendor|Vendor]] issues — not reacting once a [[3-glossary#delivery|Delivery]] goes sideways.

---

## Manage [[3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] [[3-glossary#engagement|Engagement]]

This process is where [[3-glossary#influence|Influence]] is maintained, [[3-glossary#expectations|Expectations]] are managed, and relationships are protected. You already identified stakeholders and planned how to engage them — now you carry it out.

Inputs include the [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] [[3-glossary#engagement|Engagement]] plan|[[3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] [[3-glossary#engagement|Engagement]] Plan]], project documents, communications plans, and the current mood of your stakeholders (harder to quantify, but just as important).

Tools here are strategic and emotional: [[3-glossary#communication|Communication]], [[3-glossary#negotiation|Negotiation]], [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#conflict|Conflict]] [[3-glossary#resolution|Resolution]]|[[3-glossary#conflict|Conflict]] [[3-glossary#resolution|Resolution]]]], [[3-glossary#facilitation|Facilitation]], and [[3-glossary#cultural awareness|Cultural awareness]].

When this process works, stakeholders stay [[3-glossary#informed|Informed]] and invested. When it’s skipped, even a perfect deliverable can feel like a failure.

## What You Should Take Away

Executing ITTOs are active. They move, shift, and adapt in real time. They aren’t about [[3-glossary#governance|Governance]] — they’re about **getting the job done**, while staying aligned with plans, people, and purpose.

On the exam, watch for signals like:
- The work has begun
- Stakeholders are reacting to deliverables
- Risks are being addressed
- Teams are [[3-glossary#forming|Forming]], [[3-glossary#storming|Storming]], or [[3-glossary#norming|Norming]]

You’re not in setup anymore — you’re in motion. Executing ITTOs help you keep that motion on track.

## Questions Worth Exploring

- What signals that a [[3-glossary#communication|Communication]] breakdown is an execution [[3-glossary#issue|Issue]], not a planning miss?
- How do [[3-glossary#issue|Issue]] logs and [[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]] evolve in Executing?
- What distinguishes effective [[3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] [[3-glossary#engagement|Engagement]] during execution?
- How do [[3-glossary#lessons learned|Lessons learned]] get captured while the work is still in progress?
