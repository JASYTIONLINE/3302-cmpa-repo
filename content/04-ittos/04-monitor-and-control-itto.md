## Monitoring & Controlling – The [[3-glossary#feedback|Feedback]] Loop of Project Reality

Monitoring and Controlling is where data meets decision. In this process group, you’re no longer asking, *“Are we ready to start?”* — you're asking, *“Is this still working?”*

The ITTOs here don’t launch work — they measure it, judge it, and adjust it. They track what’s happening, compare it to what was planned, and help decide what changes (if any) are needed. And when change is necessary? These processes handle how it’s approved, documented, and communicated.

Each process in this group serves as a *checkpoint* — some passive (monitoring), others active (controlling). Together, they keep the project aligned with its intent, even when conditions shift. Below, we’ll explore the ITTOs living inside these containers — not as trivia, but as the tools that [[3-glossary#power|Power]] judgment, correction, and course recalibration.

## Monitor and Control Project Work

This is the high-altitude, wide-angle process that oversees everything — [[3-glossary#scope|Scope]], [[3-glossary#schedule|Schedule]], cost, [[3-glossary#risk|Risk]], [[3-glossary#quality|Quality]], and [[3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] [[3-glossary#engagement|Engagement]]. The ITTOs here are tuned for **visibility** and **actionable insights**.

Inputs include [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] data, forecasts, the [[3-glossary#project management plan|Project management plan]], and updates from executing processes. Tools like [[3-glossary#earned [[3-glossary#value|Value]]|Earned [[3-glossary#value|Value]]]] Management (EVM), trend analysis, [[3-glossary#forecasting|Forecasting]], and root-cause analysis help interpret what’s working and what’s drifting.

Outputs? You’re looking at work [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] [[3-glossary#reports|Reports]], [[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]], and updates to baselines. This process doesn’t do the work — it ensures the work stays on track, or pivots cleanly when it doesn’t.

## Perform Integrated [[3-glossary#change control|Change control]]

This is where [[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]] go to be judged. The ITTOs here help evaluate each proposed modification for [[3-glossary#impact|Impact]], feasibility, and [[3-glossary#alignment|Alignment]] with project goals.

Inputs include [[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]] themselves (of course), but also the plans and documents that might be affected. Tools include expert judgment, decision-making models, and often a formal [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#change control|Change control]] board|[[3-glossary#change control|Change control]] board]] (CCB).

The key output — **approved or rejected [[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]]** — feeds back into every other group. This is the firewall that prevents change chaos. Without it, your project turns into a suggestion box with a [[3-glossary#gantt chart|Gantt chart]].

## Validate [[3-glossary#scope|Scope]] and [[3-glossary#control [[3-glossary#scope|Scope]]|Control [[3-glossary#scope|Scope]]]]

Validate [[3-glossary#scope|Scope]] ensures the work being delivered is what was promised — and that it's officially accepted. The ITTOs focus on verification: [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#scope|Scope]] [[3-glossary#baseline|Baseline]]|[[3-glossary#scope|Scope]] [[3-glossary#baseline|Baseline]]]], [[3-glossary#requirements|Requirements]] [[3-glossary#documentation|Documentation]], and [[3-glossary#inspection|Inspection]].

[[3-glossary#control [[3-glossary#scope|Scope]]|Control [[3-glossary#scope|Scope]]]], on the other hand, checks whether any unplanned expansion (aka [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#scope|Scope]] creep|[[3-glossary#scope|Scope]] creep]]) is sneaking in. Inputs include [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] data, WBS documents, and change logs. [[3-glossary#data analysis|Data analysis]] tools help evaluate variance between what was planned and what’s showing up.

Together, these processes answer: Are we building the right thing — and only the right thing?

## Control [[3-glossary#schedule|Schedule]] and Control Costs

These two processes help ensure the project stays realistic about **time** and **money**. Their ITTOs often overlap, but they track different pain points.

Control [[3-glossary#schedule|Schedule]] draws from the [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#schedule|Schedule]] [[3-glossary#baseline|Baseline]]|[[3-glossary#schedule|Schedule]] [[3-glossary#baseline|Baseline]]]], [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] data, and forecasts. You’ll see [[3-glossary#critical path|Critical path]] analysis, what-if scenarios, trend analysis, and variance evaluations. When the timeline slips, this is where it’s spotted.

Control Costs uses similar tools, but adds [[3-glossary#budget|Budget]]-focused inputs: funding [[3-glossary#requirements|Requirements]], cost forecasts, and actual expenditures. Techniques like reserve analysis and EVM come into play, allowing you to compare [[3-glossary#baseline|Baseline]] vs. actual vs. projected cost.

Outputs for both include updated forecasts, [[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]], and new [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] [[3-glossary#reports|Reports]] — the raw materials for realignment.

## Control [[3-glossary#quality|Quality]] and Control [[3-glossary#resources|Resources]]

Control [[3-glossary#quality|Quality]] examines the outputs of the project — deliverables, processes, and [[3-glossary#documentation|Documentation]] — to ensure they meet [[3-glossary#standards|Standards]]. Inputs include [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#quality|Quality]] [[3-glossary#metrics|Metrics]]|[[3-glossary#quality|Quality]] [[3-glossary#metrics|Metrics]]]], test results, and [[3-glossary#lessons learned|Lessons learned]]. Tools include inspections, sampling, and control charts. The output? Verified deliverables, [[3-glossary#quality|Quality]] [[3-glossary#reports|Reports]], and, if needed, [[3-glossary#change requests|Change requests]].

Control [[3-glossary#resources|Resources]] watches how people, equipment, and materials are actually being used. You’ll track [[3-glossary#availability|Availability]], usage logs, and capacity. When gaps or overloads appear, this process flags them. It answers the question: *Do we have what we need — and are we using it well?*

## Monitor Communications and Monitor [[3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] [[3-glossary#engagement|Engagement]]

These processes listen more than they talk. They track whether planned [[3-glossary#communication|Communication]] is happening — and whether stakeholders are responding as expected.

Monitor Communications checks if the message is getting through. Inputs include the communications management plan, project documents, and [[3-glossary#feedback|Feedback]]. Outputs are [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] insights and, if needed, updates to how information is being shared.

Monitor [[3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] [[3-glossary#engagement|Engagement]] goes deeper: are stakeholders engaged, satisfied, [[3-glossary#informed|Informed]]? Or are they silent, disengaged, or pushing back? The ITTOs here include interpersonal [[3-glossary#feedback|Feedback]] loops, monitoring tools, and direct observation. Outputs often include recommendations for re-[[3-glossary#engagement|Engagement]] or [[3-glossary#mitigation|Mitigation]].

## Monitor Risks and Control Procurements

Monitor Risks evaluates whether the responses you planned are still working — or whether new risks have emerged. Inputs include the [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] register|[[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] register]], response plans, and actual [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] data. Tools like audits, reassessments, and [[3-glossary#data analysis|Data analysis]] techniques allow you to assess [[3-glossary#probability|Probability]], [[3-glossary#impact|Impact]], and proximity in real time.

Control Procurements ensures that what was promised by vendors is being delivered — and that [[3-glossary#contracts|Contracts]] are still valid. Inputs include agreements, procurement [[3-glossary#documentation|Documentation]], and [[3-glossary#inspection|Inspection]] [[3-glossary#reports|Reports]]. Outputs often include payment approvals, updated [[3-glossary#contracts|Contracts]], and sometimes formal claims administration.

## What You Should Take Away

Monitoring and Controlling is **not a single moment** — it’s a continuous rhythm of observing, analyzing, deciding, and acting. The ITTOs here form the nervous system of the project. They gather data, interpret it, and [[3-glossary#trigger|Trigger]] changes that keep the project alive and aligned.

On the exam, look for clues like:
- [[3-glossary#performance|Performance]] data is being reviewed
- Forecasts are being updated
- Change is being considered, requested, or approved
- A project is off course — and someone [[3-glossary#needs|Needs]] to respond

That’s the Monitoring and Controlling mindset: diagnose, decide, and adjust.

## Questions Worth Exploring

- What distinguishes a change request from an [[3-glossary#issue|Issue]] — and how do ITTOs handle both?
- How does monitoring [[3-glossary#risk|Risk]] differ from controlling [[3-glossary#scope|Scope]]?
- What tools help you determine when [[3-glossary#stakeholder|Stakeholder]] [[3-glossary#engagement|Engagement]] is failing?
- How do outputs from [[3-glossary#[[3-glossary#quality|Quality]] control|[[3-glossary#quality|Quality]] control]] feed back into the monitoring cycle?
