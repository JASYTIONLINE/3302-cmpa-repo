## Initiating Process Group – The Starting Point of Alignment

The [[3-glossary#initiating-process-group|Initiating Process Group]] contains the [[3-glossary#inputs|ITTOs]] that bring a [[3-glossary#project|project]] to life. This is where formal authorization is secured, and where key [[01-stakeholder|stakeholders]] are first identified. The ITTOs in this group aren’t about delivery — they’re about **definition**. They provide the structure and insight to answer two questions: *What are we doing?* and *Who needs to be involved from the start?*

This page explores the ITTOs for the two initiating processes — **[[3-glossary#develop-project-charter|Develop Project Charter]]** and **[[3-glossary#identify-stakeholders|Identify Stakeholders]]** — and explains how each input, tool, and output supports early project alignment. You don’t need to memorize them. You need to see how they work together to create clarity, authority, and a shared foundation.

## Develop Project Charter

This process produces the **[[3-glossary#project-charter|project charter]]**, the artifact that gives the [[3-glossary#project-manager|project manager]] authority and formally initiates the project. It captures high-level [[3-glossary#scope|scope]], goals, constraints, and [[3-glossary#sponsor|sponsor]] alignment.

### **Inputs**
- **[[3-glossary#business-case|Business documents]]** – [[3-glossary#business-case|business case]] and [[3-glossary#benefits-management-plan|benefits management plan]]  
- **[[3-glossary#agreement|Agreements]]** – contracts, statements of work, or other formal arrangements  
- **[[03-eef-opa|Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)]]**  
- **[[03-eef-opa|Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)]]**

### **Tools & Techniques**
- **[[3-glossary#expert-judgment|Expert judgment]]** – sponsor input, domain expertise  
- **[[3-glossary#data-gathering|Data gathering]]** – brainstorming, interviews  
- **[[3-glossary#interpersonal-and-team-skills|Interpersonal & team skills]]** – conflict resolution, facilitation  
- **[[3-glossary#meetings|Meetings]]** – formal sessions to align with sponsors  

### **Outputs**
- **[[3-glossary#project-charter|Project Charter]]** – defines purpose, authority, and high-level direction  

This is the permission to proceed — without it, there is no project.

## Identify Stakeholders

This process creates the **[[3-glossary#stakeholder-register|stakeholder register]]**, which maps who is impacted by the project, how much influence they have, and how they need to be engaged. It’s the social blueprint for success.

### **Inputs**
- **[[3-glossary#project-charter|Project charter]]**  
- **[[3-glossary#business-case|Business documents]]**  
- **[[3-glossary#agreement|Agreements]]**  
- **[[03-eef-opa|EEFs and OPAs]]**

### **Tools & Techniques**
- **[[3-glossary#expert-judgment|Expert judgment]]**  
- **[[3-glossary#data-analysis|Data analysis]]** – stakeholder analysis, document review  
- **[[3-glossary#data-representation|Data representation]]** – [[3-glossary#power-interest-grid|power/interest grids]], [[3-glossary#salience-model|salience models]]  
- **[[3-glossary#meetings|Meetings]]** – input from leadership, teams, and functions  

### **Outputs**
- **[[3-glossary#stakeholder-register|Stakeholder Register]]** – the living document of influence and engagement  

Without knowing your stakeholders, your project will drift. This process gives you your map.

## What to Watch For on the Exam

Initiating ITTOs won’t be tested as lists — they’ll show up as **scenarios**. Look for moments when:  
- Work hasn’t started yet  
- Authorization is unclear  
- [[01-stakeholder|Stakeholder]] needs are emerging  
- Definitions are still forming  

That’s your cue: you’re in Initiating.

## Questions Worth Exploring

- What [[02-risk|risk]] emerges when stakeholder identification is skipped or rushed?  
- What causes a [[3-glossary#sponsor|project sponsor]] to reject a charter?  
- How do [[03-eef-opa|OPAs]] influence both of these processes?  
- In a scenario, how can you tell if a [[3-glossary#stakeholder-register|stakeholder register]] already exists?  

Knowing these ITTOs means understanding how projects are born — and what happens if they start without alignment.
