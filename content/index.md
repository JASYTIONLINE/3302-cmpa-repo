## Purpose

It exists to demonstrate mastery of CMPA 3302 learning outcomes while also serving as a practical tool for preparing for the **PMP Certification Exam**.  

In the context of the course, this site shows my ability to:
- Structure information into **logical categories**.  
- Apply **PMBOK 6 and PMBOK 7 principles**.  
- Build and maintain a functioning **digital knowledge base**.  

For professional development, it is intended to:
- Collect and organize **study materials** for PMP exam readiness.  
- Provide a **reference library** that grows over time.  
- Support **search, browse, and discovery** of concepts through interlinked content.  

The site is not just for assignments ‚Äî it is designed to be **a living system** that blends coursework with ongoing PMP exam study and professional project management practice.
