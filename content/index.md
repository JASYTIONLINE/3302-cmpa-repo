# JASYTI's Project Management Professional Knowledge Base – HOME

CMPA 3302 — Foundations of Information Organization & Management  
Welcome to my Website. I am JASYTI, but I'm not just another social you Tube influencer.

## Purpose
This site is both a **course project** and a **personal knowledge base**.  
It exists to demonstrate mastery of CMPA 3302 learning outcomes while also serving as a practical tool for preparing for the **PMP Certification Exam**.  

In the context of the course, this site shows my ability to:
- Structure information into **logical categories**.  
- Apply **PMBOK 6 and PMBOK 7 principles**.  
- Build and maintain a functioning **digital knowledge base**.  

For professional development, it is intended to:
- Collect and organize **study materials** for PMP exam readiness.  
- Provide a **reference library** that grows over time.  
- Support **search, browse, and discovery** of concepts through interlinked content.  

The site is not just for assignments — it is designed to be **a living system** that blends coursework with ongoing PMP exam study and professional project management practice.

## How to Use This Site
This site is organized into **categories**, each representing a major domain of project management knowledge.  
Here’s how to navigate effectively:

1. **Start with Quick Links**  
   - Use the **Quick Links panel** below to jump directly to About, References, Glossary, or the repository README.  Generaly: Quick links take you to other pages in the same folder and Navigation Links take you to other index pages in related catagories outside the folders.
   - These pages give you context and supporting resources.  

2. **Explore Main Categories**  
   - Each category index page introduces its section and lists the subpages.  
   - Categories are interconnected with “Related Categories” links to support discovery.  

3. **Use the Glossary**  
   - Throughout the site are inline links to terms in the [[3-glossary|Glossary]]
   - The Glossary provides quick definitions of key project management terms.
   - It also contextual clarifications to help you internalize and understand the term as opposed to just memorizing its definition.  

4. **Look for Embedded Media**  
   - Some pages include images, diagrams, or PDFs in the `assets/` folder.  
   - These demonstrate rubric requirements and provide study aids.  

5. **Bottom Navigation**  
   - Long pages include navigation at the bottom to return to the Home page or the current category index.  

By combining structured navigation with inter-page links, the site supports **search, browse, and discovery** — the three main ways users interact with organized information.  

NOTE: If you want to Study without Studying and break free from the hum drum standard form of study, make sure to enjoy the story woven through this site: **[[05-tlg/index|The Last Gate]]** — a narrative experiment in blending fiction with project management principles.
