# JASYTI's Project Management Professional Knowledge Base
CMPA 3302 
## Purpose
This site is my **course portal** and serves as a **knowledge base dedicated to Project Management and preparation for the PMP Certification Exam**.  Its primary function is to serve as the entry point into the repository, allowing quick access to all contents related to my studies on Project Management.

## My goal
I am studying to pass the **Project Management Institute’s** PMP Certification Exam.  
My long-term goal is to learn the memory elements required to pass the PMP exam’s multiple-choice questions while also preparing for the scenario-based questions by practicing and “living” PMI in my daily activities. I chose PMP as my topic because building this knowledge base not only fulfills the course requirement but also reinforces my knowledge, skills, and abilities in applying the PMBOK approach to project management.

## References
- The **PMBOK 6th Edition** organizes project management into five process groups and ten knowledge areas. The process groups—Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing—lay out the cycle of how projects are run from start to finish. The knowledge areas cover the skills, tools, and techniques a project manager needs, like scope, time, cost, quality, and risk. Together, they give a structured view of project management as a step-by-step system.  
- The **PMBOK 7th Edition** takes a different angle. Instead of focusing on process groups and knowledge areas, it emphasizes eight performance domains that highlight the value and outcomes of a project. These domains include stakeholders, team, development approach and life cycle, planning, project work, delivery, measurement, and uncertainty. PMBOK 7 is less about memorizing processes and more about principles that adapt to different projects.

Over time, this repo will grow into a structured reference that supports both coursework and professional development.
