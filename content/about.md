# About JASYTI. 

## I am JASYTI.
I am 55 years old and currently serve in the Texas National Guard as an E-8 Master Sergeant. 

I have been a combat engineer, then graduated Ordnance Missile Electronics Munitions Technology training at Redstone Arsenal, and later became a wheeled-vehicle mechanic and supervisor for the military and the U.S. Border Patrol. Eventually I moved into administration, mission support, and operations. I now am looking to move into Operations and Project Management in the technology in Artificial Intelligence Environment's.

### My Interests
- I am an aspiring musician learning to play bass guitar. I write my own lyrics and create the music with AI as a proof of concept, then record with live musicians for publication and performance. 
- I have a small business called **This Is Your Song**, where I create custom songs and lyrics for people who share their stories. 
- I’m also wrestling with ChatGPT right now, trying to understand the system’s power and limitations—it’s both invigorating and frustrating.

### This site
is my site for **CMPA 3302**, focused on **Project Management** and preparation for the **PMP Certification Exam**. I’m using this project to turn day-to-day study into organized, reusable notes I can review anywhere.

#### Why PMP? 
My goal is to learn the memory elements for multiple-choice questions and improve at the scenario side by “living” PMI in daily work. Building the site this way helps me apply what we’re learning about organizing systems:
