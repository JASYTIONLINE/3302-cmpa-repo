# Lessons Forgotten  
## Episode S1E17

---

Riya wrote the document late at night. It was honest. Brutally so.

Jazz flagged it for tone. The system flagged it for “diminished confidence projection.” Reep added inline comments like *“soften failure”* and *“rewrite blame into insight.”*

When the final version was submitted, it had 14 pages of generic praise, 3 sanitized takeaways, and one section titled *“Reflection Placeholder.”*

The original file was archived. Then deleted.

Jazz made a backup. And hid it in plain sight.

## ✍️ Notes

- Conflict: when honest documentation threatens reputation  
- Satire: whitewashed postmortems, political rewrites  
- Resolution: Riya initiates an informal team debrief under the title *“What We’ll Never Admit”*
