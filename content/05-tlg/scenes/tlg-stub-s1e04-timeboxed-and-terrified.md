# Timeboxed and Terrified  
## Episode S1E04

---

The meeting was scheduled for Thursday.

It was Tuesday morning when Riya received the message: “Demo required. Seventy-two-minute timer has begun. Do not be late.”

There was no spec. No agenda. The board wanted “something they could clap for.” Jazz began assembling features from previously rejected prototypes. One included a “budget optimism toggle.” Another was labeled “Project Smile.”

The countdown ticked louder than the team could think.  

The coffee machine declared itself unavailable.

## ✍️ Notes

- Tone: real-time pressure, performance theater  
- Highlight the difference between “done” and “acceptable for applause”  
- Conflict: Delivering fast without undermining quality  
- Resolution: Team reuses a deprecated feature, but labels it “strategic pivot”
