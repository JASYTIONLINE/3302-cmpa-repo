# Quality Assurance Pending  
## Episode S1E06

---

The build passed all 22 automated tests.

No one remembered writing the requirements.

Jazz compiled a retrospective of similar deliverables and presented a “composite definition of done.” It included a mood score, user-facing documentation in haiku, and compatibility with devices no longer manufactured.

The demo worked. Sort of.

It glowed, beeped, and caused only mild system lag. When asked what it was, the team froze.

Someone answered, “It’s a solution.”

Everyone clapped.

## ✍️ Notes

- Tone: procedural confidence masking total ambiguity  
- Satire target: box-checking QA, unclear scope, celebrating unknowns  
- Resolution: Riya files a Lessons Learned titled “Document Everything” — it is denied for lack of specificity
