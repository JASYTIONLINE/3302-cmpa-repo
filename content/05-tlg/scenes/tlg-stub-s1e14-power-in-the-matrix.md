# Power in the Matrix  
## Episode S1E14

---

Shared leadership sounded empowering.

In practice, it was a diplomatic crisis.

Five people claimed lead status. One based on experience, one based on role, one based on charisma, and two based on ‚Äúvibes.‚Äù Jazz tried to map accountability using a RACI matrix. It returned a perfect circle.

Meetings multiplied. So did conflicting decisions.

The Gate asked who to hold responsible. No one answered. Everyone nodded.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes

- Central metaphor: too many captains on a spaceship  
- Satire: the illusion of shared ownership without clear accountability  
- Resolution: Jazz assigns decision rights to a randomized bot. Chaos improves. Slightly.
