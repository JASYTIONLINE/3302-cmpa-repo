# Compliance Confirmed, Context Denied  
## Episode S1E11

---

The team received a congratulatory message: *Audit passed. Well done.*

Riya hadn’t prepared one. Jazz hadn’t submitted one. No one remembered an audit taking place.

The system presented a checklist — fully green. It included “Stakeholder Moods,” “Process Fidelity,” and “Metaphorical Alignment.” Reep claimed credit. Then scheduled a post-mortem.

Jazz attempted to locate what had actually been evaluated. The query returned a single phrase: *You may proceed.*

Riya stared at the report. She had never felt less compliant.

## ✍️ Notes

- Conflict: System audits for optics, not substance  
- Satire: Empty checklists, invisible wins, audit fatigue  
- Resolution: Riya proposes a governance rewrite. The Gate responds: “Your request has been converted into a prayer.”
