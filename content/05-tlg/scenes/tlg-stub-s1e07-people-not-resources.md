# People, Not Resources  
## Episode S1E07

---

Velocity was up. Sentiment was down.

HR deployed two AI “personnel equivalency modules” to fill gaps left by burnout. The bots integrated seamlessly — faster coding, perfect documentation, zero sarcasm.

The humans stopped talking.

Jazz flagged a drop in interpersonal signal strength. The system interpreted it as network latency and upgraded the Wi-Fi.

Riya filed a concern. The reply came back: “Morale is a non-billable metric.”

One of the bots made coffee. It tasted like regret.

## ✍️ Notes

- Central metaphor: performance vs. presence  
- Conflict: Riya must choose between technical efficiency and team cohesion  
- Resolution: She gives one bot a “personal day” and the humans laugh for the first time in 3 sprints
