The oxygen report blinked. Riya Vedanta stared at the data like it owed her an apology. CO₂ levels had stabilized. Flow-rate variance was within safe thresholds. The system was green across the board.

Which meant nothing.

“Stability” was just delay in disguise.

She sighed and tapped the screen. A fresh log entry opened, and she filed the anomaly as routine. No action. No risk response. She selected [[90-glossary#Acceptance (risk response)|Acceptance (risk response)]] from the dropdown, not because it was right — but because it was what they always did. The polite way of saying: *we’re not going to fix this until it breaks something.*

Her workstation buzzed as the form submitted, kicking the problem down the chain. Probably straight into someone else’s inbox. Someone more optimistic. Someone who still believed that process was protection. She took a sip of coffee that had long since gone cold, tasting like rust and resignation. In the upper corner of her HUD, a status icon pulsed: grey — not red, not green. A stalled [[90-glossary#Go/no-go) Gate|Go/No-Go Gate]]. Another decision stuck in limbo, waiting for confidence the system didn’t have and judgment it couldn’t fake.


Riya rubbed her temples, then sipped her coffee. It had long since gone cold. The taste was somewhere between antifreeze and disappointment.

Behind her, the view through the forward window revealed open space — sterile, silent, merciless. She stared at the stars until her reflection ghosted into view. Hollow eyes. Tight jaw. Sleepless skin.

The kind of look that said: I used to believe in process.

A soft chime nudged her HUD. System audit: completed.

She swiped it away without reading.

And that’s when it happened.

A flicker.

A single status light at the edge of her dashboard blinked. Not red. Not green.

Grey.

A [[../glossary.md#Yes/No (go/no-go) Gate|Yes/No (go/no-go) Gate]] in stasis — suspended between decision states. No output. No override. No logic.

She leaned in, frowning. GoKnow hadn’t stalled like this in weeks.

She tapped the console.

No response.

Another blink.

Then her screen went black.
