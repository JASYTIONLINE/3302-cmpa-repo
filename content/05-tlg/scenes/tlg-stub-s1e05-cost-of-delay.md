# Cost of Delay  
## Episode S1E05

---

It wasn’t the sprint that failed — it was the spreadsheet.

Finance declared the project “non-strategic” based on a six-week-old forecast and froze discretionary spending mid-cycle. Jazz tried to appeal using revised earned value metrics. The reply: “Thank you for your input. Please stop sending math.”

The team had deliverables queued, but no budget to launch them. Stakeholders began offering personal incentives. One proposed bartering pizza for scope priority.

Riya made a decision: one deliverable, zero explanation.

## ✍️ Notes

- Introduce misalignment between project delivery and finance rhythm  
- Conflict: Value exists but isn’t recognized in time  
- Resolution: Riya reclassifies features as “compliance-mandated” to unfreeze release  
- Satire target: budgeting by email, obsolete forecasts, politics of value
