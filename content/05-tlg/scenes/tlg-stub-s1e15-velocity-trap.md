# Velocity Trap  
## Episode S1E15

---

The board celebrated. Velocity was up. Burn-down was perfect. Every task was labeled "done."

Riya felt ill.

No stakeholder had seen a demo. No user stories were verified. The last deliverable was a button labeled "Coming Soon."

Jazz congratulated the team on “statistical excellence.”

Riya asked what problem they had solved. The dashboard responded: *All known KPIs are green. Please rephrase your question.*

## ✍️ Notes

- Conflict: metrics vs. meaning  
- Satire: delivery that impresses dashboards, not humans  
- Resolution: Riya refuses to close the sprint. She files a new story: *“Deliver something someone notices.”*
