# Hybrid Vigor  
## Episode S1E12

---

The Agile faction had a kanban wall and a battle plan.

The Predictive traditionalists arrived with a Gantt chart and two binders labeled “Phase Gate 2a.”

Both declared the sprint theirs. Neither blinked.

Jazz mediated. The system refused to pick sides. Riya called for a vote — the sprint lost.

Someone suggested a hybrid approach. Jazz nodded and generated a new framework. It required three burndown charts and a quarterly roadmap. No one understood it, but everyone agreed it felt inclusive.
