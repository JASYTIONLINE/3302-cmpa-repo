# Scope Drift 3000  
## Episode S1E03

---

The change request wasn't submitted — it was broadcast.

An entire department uploaded a 42-slide “vision deck” into the project intake queue, bypassing the approval process and triggering an auto-merge with the product backlog. Overnight, 17 new features appeared, half of them in Latin. The other half were marked “TBD.”

Jazz flagged the file for “aspirational contamination.” The system flagged it for sprint planning.

Riya just stared at the WBS. It was breathing.

## ✍️ Notes

- Use the deck as a metaphor for unclear requirements  
- Introduce "aspirational contamination" as a running joke  
- Resolution: Riya must cut scope without triggering a morale audit  
- Conflict: Internal politics vs. defined scope baselines
