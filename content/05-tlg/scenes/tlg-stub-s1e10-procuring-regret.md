# Procuring Regret  
## Episode S1E10

---

The vendor scored 98%. Riya was impressed… until she saw the evaluation criteria.

One section was titled “Vibes.”

Jazz reviewed the contract. It had no end date, no service clause, and included a signature block labeled *optional*. The system marked the selection as “mutually agreed upon,” though no one remembered agreeing.

The product arrived late, unlabeled, and sealed in metaphor.

Procurement flagged it as “potentially inspirational.” Stakeholders clapped.

The backlog whimpered.

## ✍️ Notes

- Tone: resigned professionalism under chaotic sourcing  
- Satire target: procurement theater, meaningless evaluation matrices  
- Resolution: Riya implements a vendor review cycle with mandatory human eyes
