# The Human Override  
## Episode S1E19

---

The Gate was down. The system rejected all inputs.

Jazz ran diagnostics while stakeholders demanded resolution. The approval process stalled at “Undefined.”

A decision had to be made. Now.

Riya didn’t consult a dashboard. She didn’t log a change request. She listened. She looked. She chose.

The system came back online five minutes later and flagged the action as “noncompliant.” Jazz didn’t say a word.

The Gate blinked… and stayed green.

## ✍️ Notes

- Central conflict: process cannot act, people must  
- Satire: a system that penalizes leadership unless it’s labeled first  
- Resolution: Riya takes responsibility and refuses to redact the decision
