# The End (Probably)  
## Episode S1E21

---

The backlog was empty. The sprint board said “Complete.” The Gate was dark.

Riya sat where it had all started. She no longer hovered over the Risk Register. She didn’t ask Jazz to repeat itself. She didn’t apologize for process.

Dom joked about building something without approval.  
Taz rolled her eyes, bored — but oddly proud.  
Nabler said nothing. He looked at Jazz like his job was done.

They laughed.

They remembered.

Riya stared out the viewport.

“I think we did it,” she said.

Jazz blinked. “You did it within scope, schedule, and budget. There’s nothing else.”

The Gate blinked.

Grey.

## ✍️ Notes

- Ends Season 1 on a quiet beat  
- Tone: earned confidence, reflective  
- Learner takeaway: *“You’ve walked the path. Now take the test.”*  
- Cliffhanger for S2: The Gate blinks not to restart the project — but to open the real one
