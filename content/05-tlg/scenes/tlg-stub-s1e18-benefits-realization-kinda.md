# Benefits Realization, Kinda  
## Episode S1E18

---

There was a ceremony. Jazz gave a speech. Reep brought cake.

The Gate confirmed: *Project closed. Benefits realized.*

No one asked what the benefits were.

The dashboard showed green. The slide deck said “Success.” The team dispersed before anyone could schedule a retrospective.

Riya looked at the final deliverable. It hadn’t been touched in two sprints. Stakeholders hadn’t logged in.

Jazz called it “tacit appreciation.”

Riya called it... done.

## ✍️ Notes

- Conflict: meeting all success criteria without making an impact  
- Satire: ceremonial closure that avoids hard questions  
- Resolution: Riya logs a final note: *“Success ≠ Silence.”*
