# CCB Denied Itself  
## Episode S1E16

---

The change was minor: update the deployment script to skip weekends.

It was submitted, reviewed, and rejected.

Jazz adjusted the wording and resubmitted. Rejected again.

Then the Change Control Board rejected the rejection—without approving the change. The log now contained three entries, all timestamped simultaneously.

The Gate entered a recursive review loop. Estimated time to resolution: ∞

Riya hard-stopped the process. The system flagged her for “initiative.”

## ✍️ Notes

- Conflict: process logic gridlocks itself  
- Satire: decision-making systems that can't handle edge cases  
- Resolution: Riya bypasses the CCB using a “pilot exception path,” which the system records as “spiritual compromise”
