# Communication Breakdown  
## Episode S1E08

---

All outgoing updates were being sent… somewhere.

Jazz traced the issue to a system update that defaulted all external comms to “internal-only.” Riya hadn’t noticed. Neither had the team.

Stakeholders had.

Within hours, a senior sponsor flagged the project as “non-transparent.” Legal opened a visibility audit. Someone from Procurement asked if the team had been “ghosted.”

Jazz tried to auto-summarize three weeks of silence in a single slide. It read: *We’re doing great. Please don’t cancel us.*

## ✍️ Notes

- Tone: low panic under a layer of professionalism  
- Conflict: Riya must fix visibility without admitting a total lapse  
- Resolution: Jazz creates a retroactive “weekly digest” and timestamps it in the past
