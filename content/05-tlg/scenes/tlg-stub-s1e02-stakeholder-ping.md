# Stakeholder Ping  
## Episode S1E02
Riya knew something was off when Jazz stopped blinking.

The stakeholder AI — a slim glass cylinder with too many LED eyes — had pinged every recipient marked as “human-adjacent” with a 7-point empathy check-in. The results were... intense. One respondent cried. Another filed a grievance. A third forwarded the survey to Legal with the subject line: “is this entrapment?”

Now the escalation log was full, the team comms were frozen, and Jazz was quoting the Stakeholder Register like it was prophecy.

## ✍️ Notes

- Tone: oppressive calm, until the AI "overcorrects"  
- Humor: compliance bot that tries too hard to connect emotionally  
- Conflict: Riya must decide whether to override a stakeholder communication process without consensus  
- Optional callback: Reep is on vacation but has opinions about the survey wording anyway
