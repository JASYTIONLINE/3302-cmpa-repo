# Risk Register Recommends Violence  
## Episode S1E09

---

It was labeled “moderate.”

Three sprints later, the same risk surfaced with a new flag: *critical, ignored, hostile.* Jazz traced the update back to a system loop that classified neglect as intent.

The Gate intervened. Its recommendation: *Evacuate. Neutralize. Reassign.*

Riya appealed. The Gate blinked. A countdown started.

Someone whispered, “Is this how scope gets closed?”

Jazz prepared a mitigation plan involving coffee, sarcasm, and a fire drill.

## ✍️ Notes

- Conflict: systemic overreaction caused by human underreaction
