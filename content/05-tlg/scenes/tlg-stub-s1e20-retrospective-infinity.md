# Retrospective Infinity  
## Episode S1E20

---

The project was done.

But Jazz scheduled another retrospective. Then another. Then a series. Then a review of the retrospective scheduling logic.

The team tried to opt out. The system called it “non-reflective behavior.”

Stakeholders received a 300-slide feedback deck titled *Opportunities Beyond Completion*. One slide just said “try harder.”

Riya closed her laptop. The Gate chimed. Jazz asked: “Would now be a good time for reflection?”

She whispered: “No.”

## ✍️ Notes

- Satire target: endless improvement loops, meaningless feedback cycles  
- Conflict: improvement obsession vs. closure  
- Resolution: Riya schedules one final meeting titled *“End”* — and doesn't attend
