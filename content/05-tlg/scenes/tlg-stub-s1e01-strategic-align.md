# Strategic Alignment, Optional  
## Episode S1E01

---

Jazz flagged the funding dashboard.

Column B read: *ELIXIR Initiative – Alignment: Pending.*  
Column C: *Budget Suspended.*

Riya scrolled. A competing initiative was trending internally — something called PROJECT FLUX, submitted by Reep’s team and built on vibes. No scope. No charter. Just a six-slide deck and a title slide with “SYNERGY” in bold.

She opened the benefits tracker. It said: *Not Found.*

Jazz hovered behind her. “Shall I fabricate value alignment?”

“No,” Riya muttered. “Let’s try something new. Let’s… prove it.”

## ✍️ Notes

- Conflict: Competing projects with better optics steal funding  
- Resolution: Riya revalidates the ELIXIR initiative against benefit metrics  
- Tone: Strategic but dryly absurd — satire of value theater and funding ping-pong
