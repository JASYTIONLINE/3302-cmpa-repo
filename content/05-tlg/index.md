# The Lore Door  
## Your Portal to the PMP Universe of The Last Gate!
![image of Deep Space Station FUBAR](fubar6.png)

*Welcome to Deep Space Station: F.U.B.A.R 6; the story side of this system.*

This isn’t a case study. This isn’t a course. This is a record.

A record of people doing what they must — inside a system that often makes no sense — and somehow, still delivering value by following something older than bureaucracy, older than chaos:

**The Plan.**

Each episode below is a self-contained lesson told in narrative form.  
You can start at the top and move down, or jump anywhere you like.

If you're here, the system thinks you're ready. If you're wrong... the Gate will let you know.
