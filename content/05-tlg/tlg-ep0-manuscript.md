# Prologue: The Plan Forgotten

## A long time ago
A mysterious force kept the universe in order. This force, know only as *The Plan* was alive. Projects were guided by experienced, well-educated **Gurus and Mystics** - professionals who balanced [[#glossary|people,]] [[#glossary|process,]] and the dynamic and ever changing [[#glossary| Business Environment]] with a prowess that seemed magical and, more importantly, they always delivered [[#glossary|value.]] These guardians of [[#glossary|deliveriables,]] were entrusted to bring order to chaos and value to [[#glossary|stakeholders.]]  

At the heart of their craft was **The Plan**. Not a plan — *The Plan*. The Plan was the unseen force that bound People and Process together though [[#glossary|alignment,]] [[#glossary|purpose,]] and [[#glossary|trust.]]  These [[#glossary|"Project Managers"]] were a mystical group of Godlike Creatures, trained to sense The Plan, [[#glossary|tailor]] it, and bring order to chaos. Just as warriors carried carried pulse rifles, their tool was the art of [[#glossary|project management]] itself - sharp, disciplined, and deadly precise when wielded with wisdom.  
#### But, somewhere along the way, that all went wrong.

## Chapter 1 - The Risk
Riya sat at her desk, staring blankly at her terminal as if it owed her an apology. The oxygen report blinked like it wanted applause: a minor [[#glossary|variance]] in the 02 supply, just enough to flag the [[#glossary|Risk Register]]. It wasn’t catastrophic, not yet, but it was a problem. On this station, every small problem carried the weight of a lesson ignored.  

The system did what it was designed to do: the the AI embodiment of the [[#glossary|risk-management-plan,]] Risque Mangere pinged. Her voice slid into the channel, calm, intimate: *“We’ve identified a [[#Glossary|anomaly.]] Would you like to [[#Glossary|accept]] this risk or  [[# Glossary|mitigate]] it?”*

	    It was procedure, that looked like a choice, but procedure wasn't all its cracked up to be on DST-F.U.B.A.R 6
	    
		Before Riya could answer, the console pre-filled the form. With <a href="glossary#acceptance-(risk-response)">Risk Acceptance</a> already checked, <a href="glossary#justification">justification</a> boxes already templated Risque Mangere purred: <em>“Don’t worry. It’s filed.”</em> The oxygen variance — a genuine risk — vanished into the log, not managed, not understood, just accepted. As Riya watched the risk log automatically complete and file itself, she wondered if anyone on this station had <a href="glossary#mitigate-risk">mitigated a risk</a> in the last hundred years.
      
        She shook her head, leaned back, and took a sip of her coffee. Well, at least there was caffeine. Before she could swallow, the taste hit — faintly acidic, unmistakably wrong. Urine? She grimaced. <em>Great,</em> she thought, “looks like the waste recycling plant is on the fritz again.”
