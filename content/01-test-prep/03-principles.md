## Applying Project Management Principle on Exam Day

The PMP exam is not about memorizing definitions — it is about **applying project management principles in context**. PMI writes questions to test whether you understand the underlying concepts, not whether you can recite terms. Many questions include two possible answers that look correct, but only one is the **“most right”** because it aligns best with PMI’s situational best practices. Practicing with scenario-based questions is the only way to build the skill of distinguishing good answers from better ones.
