# Cue Cards as a Study Tool

Cue cards (sometimes called flashcards) are a proven technique for breaking complex ideas into small, test-ready prompts. A single card captures the **essence of a concept** in one line or phrase. By condensing material, cue cards allow for fast review, repetition, and recall under exam conditions.  

Common uses include:  
- Memorizing key terms, formulas, or definitions  
- Reducing lengthy text into bite-sized ideas  
- Practicing *active recall* — testing yourself until responses are automatic  
- Comparing multiple cards quickly to reinforce connections  

> **Note:** This page does *not* supply cue cards directly. Instead, it explains how to use them and encourages you to find or create your own sets. See [[content/references|References]] for official sources.

## How to Use Cue Cards Effectively

- **Keep it simple**: one idea per card.  
- **Make it active**: phrase cards as questions and answers.  
- **Mix it up**: shuffle cards to prevent rote order memorization.  
- **Repeat often**: daily review strengthens long-term memory.  
- **Use both sides**: front for the prompt, back for the concise answer or definition.  

Digital tools like Anki or Quizlet automate this process and support *spaced repetition*, while traditional index cards remain effective for tactile learners.

## Example: PMBOK 7 Principles as Cue Cards

PMBOK 7 introduces twelve guiding principles. Each can be reduced to a one-line card. Example phrasing might include:  

- **Stewardship** = act responsibly for future outcomes  
- **Tailoring** = adapt practices to context  
- **Stakeholders** = engage and respect stakeholder needs  
- **Systems Thinking** = see the whole system, not just parts  
- **Value** = focus on outcomes, not just outputs  
- **Leadership** = demonstrate collaboration and influence  
- **Team** = build a supportive environment  
- **Quality** = embed quality throughout the process  
- **Complexity** = address complexity proactively  
- **Risk** = be proactive with uncertainty  
- **Adaptability/Resilience** = respond positively to change  
- **Change** = embrace and enable beneficial transformation  

With cue cards, you don’t memorize entire definitions—you recall the *core idea* and expand it mentally in context.

## Suggested External Resources

The most reliable way to access accurate cue cards and other PMP study materials is through the **Project Management Institute (PMI)** itself. By becoming a PMI member, you gain access to official prep content, including the **PMP Exam Prep Course (Version 3.2)**, practice questions, and other resources that use terms correctly in context. These materials are vetted, up to date, and aligned with the exam. See [[content/references|References]].

⚠️ Be cautious about using crowd-sourced websites or Q&A boards that promise quick exam answers. These sites often provide incomplete, misleading, or outright wrong information. They may give you a shortcut definition, but they will not prepare you for PMI’s situational, “most right answer” style of questions. Rely on PMI’s official resources or trusted providers to ensure your preparation is accurate.
