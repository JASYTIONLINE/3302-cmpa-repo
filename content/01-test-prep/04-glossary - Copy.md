### Actual AC
## Actual Cost
#### AC
##### Definition:
The realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a specific time period.  
##### Context:
Actual Cost is exactly what it sounds like: how much money you’ve *actually* spent. It’s not a plan, and it’s not earned — it’s just what has been paid. Unlike [[#Planned Value|Planned Value (PV)]] and [[#Earned Value|Earned Value (EV)]], which are about expectations or progress, AC is the raw number pulled from your financial records. If you see: “How much did we spend so far?”, you’re talking about AC. Because it reflects *only completed work*, it’s also key in [[#variance]] and [[#forecasting]] metrics like [[#CPI|CPI]] and [[#EAC|EAC]].
##### Exam cue:  
> *You’re asked how much has been* ***spent so far*** *on a task or phase, regardless of planned budget or work completed.  
> The correct answer is usually* **Actual Cost (AC)**, *because that’s the number that reflects actual expenses incurred.*

### Accepted Deliverables  
**Definition.** Accepted deliverables are those outputs  
that have been formally approved through the **Validate Scope** process.  
They meet the defined acceptance criteria and are signed off  
by the customer, sponsor, or relevant stakeholder.  
Once accepted, they are handed off for closure, integration, or deployment.

> **Exam cue.** Don’t confuse **accepted deliverables** with “verified” ones.  
Verification (via **Control Quality**) checks technical correctness;  
acceptance (via **Validate Scope**) checks customer satisfaction.  
If acceptance criteria aren’t met, deliverables are not accepted  
and may trigger a change request, rework, or escalation.  
Accepted deliverables become inputs to **Close Project or Phase**.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-validate-scope|Validate Scope]], [[90-glossary#gloss-close-project|Close Project]], [[90-glossary#gloss-control-quality|Control Quality]], [[90-glossary#gloss-deliverable|Deliverable]]

### Accuracy 
**Definition.** Accuracy means the measured value is close to the true value.  
Precision means repeated measurements are consistent with each other.  
In project quality, accuracy is about hitting the target,  
while precision is about consistency of results, even if they’re off-target.

> **Exam cue.** If a deliverable is accurate but not precise,  
it hits the mark but inconsistently. If it's precise but not accurate,  
it consistently misses. The exam may ask you to prioritize one.  
Usually, **accuracy** wins in stakeholder satisfaction or acceptance criteria.  
**Control Quality** processes help improve both.

**Related:**

[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Acquire Resources 
**Definition.** Acquire Resources is the process of obtaining  
the people, materials, equipment, and facilities required  
to execute project work. It typically occurs during executing,  
after planning identifies what's needed.

> **Exam cue.** Don’t confuse this with **Develop Team** (building capability)  
or **Manage Team** (day-to-day supervision).  
If a question involves securing or assigning resources,  
the answer is usually **Acquire Resources**.  
This may also involve negotiation with functional managers in matrix organizations.

**Related:**

### Activity 
[[#Glossary|Top]]
**Definition.** An activity is a discrete unit of scheduled work  
that consumes time and resources and contributes to a deliverable.  
Activities are derived from the WBS and form the building blocks of the schedule.

> **Exam cue.** Activities are created during **Define Activities**,  
sequenced in **Sequence Activities**, and estimated in **Estimate Activity Durations**.  
Each activity is connected to predecessors and successors  
in the **schedule network diagram**.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-define-activities|Define Activities]], [[90-glossary#gloss-sequence-activities|Sequence Activities]], [[90-glossary#gloss-wbs|WBS]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Activity Attributes  
**Definition.** Activity attributes are metadata about a scheduled activity—  
including IDs, leads/lags, resource needs, calendar constraints, and dependencies.  
They provide detail beyond the activity list itself.

> **Exam cue.** If a question asks “Where is this info stored?”  
about resource calendars, lead/lag time, or dependencies,  
answer: **Activity Attributes**.  
It’s an output of **Define Activities** and supports sequencing, estimating, and resource leveling.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-activity|Activity]], [[90-glossary#gloss-sequence-activities|Sequence Activities]], [[90-glossary#gloss-schedule|Schedule]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Activity Duration Estimate  
**Definition.** An activity duration estimate is a prediction  
of how long a scheduled activity will take to complete,  
based on known resources, methods, and conditions.  
It’s typically expressed as a range or a single-point value.

> **Exam cue.** PMI emphasizes **three-point estimating** (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic)  
and methods like **PERT**, **analogous**, **parametric**, and **bottom-up**.  
Choose based on data availability and detail level.  
Always consider risk and assumptions in estimating.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-estimate-activity-durations|Estimate Activity Durations]], [[90-glossary#gloss-pert|PERT]], [[90-glossary#gloss-estimating-techniques|Estimating techniques]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Activity List  
**Definition.** The activity list is a complete catalog  
of all scheduled project activities, each with a unique ID and description.  
It is created as an output of **Define Activities**.

> **Exam cue.** The activity list feeds sequencing and estimating processes.  
It’s not just a to-do list—it's a **core input** for building  
the schedule model and network diagram.  
Expect exam questions on which process creates or consumes this list.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-activity|Activity]], [[90-glossary#gloss-schedule-baseline|Schedule baseline]], [[90-glossary#gloss-sequence-activities|Sequence Activities]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]] 
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Activity Network Diagram
#### AoN/PDM  
**Definition.** An activity network diagram visually displays  
activities and their logical relationships (dependencies)  
using nodes (boxes) and arrows—commonly in the **Precedence Diagramming Method**.

> **Exam cue.** Know the four relationship types:  
Finish-to-Start (FS), Finish-to-Finish (FF), Start-to-Start (SS), Start-to-Finish (SF).  
This diagram supports **critical path analysis**  
and helps identify schedule compression opportunities (crashing, fast-tracking).

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-critical-path|Critical path]], [[90-glossary#gloss-sequence-activities|Sequence Activities]], [[90-glossary#gloss-schedule-compression|Schedule compression]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Adaptive Life Cycle  
**Definition.** An adaptive life cycle delivers work  
in short, iterative increments that allow for frequent inspection and adaptation.  
It embraces change and prioritizes value delivery and customer feedback.

> **Exam cue.** Adaptive = Agile.  
Scope is flexible. Time and cost are often fixed.  
If you see uncertainty, fast feedback, evolving requirements,  
or value-first language—choose an **adaptive** approach.  
Avoid upfront full plans or predictive sequencing in these cases.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-hybrid|Hybrid (life cycle)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-mvp|MVP]], [[90-glossary#gloss-iteration|Iteration]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]] 
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Adaptive Planning  
**Definition.** Adaptive planning is the practice of creating plans  
just-in-time for near-term work while leaving future work loosely defined.  
It reflects progressive elaboration in agile and hybrid approaches.

> **Exam cue.** PMI contrasts adaptive planning with full upfront predictive planning.  
Use it in changing environments.  
Tied closely to **rolling-wave planning**, **backlog refinement**, and **incremental delivery**.  
Don’t confuse it with scope creep—it’s planned flexibility.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-rolling-wave|Rolling-wave planning]], [[90-glossary#gloss-progressive-elaboration|Progressive elaboration]], [[90-glossary#gloss-backlog|Backlog]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Adjourning  
**Definition.** The **final stage** of team development—  
when the project ends or the team disbands.  
Focus shifts to closure, recognition, and emotional transition.

> **Exam cue.** If the question describes team members leaving, handing off, or winding down—this is your stage.  
Smart PMs help celebrate and process the transition.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-tuckman-stages|Tuckman stages]], [[90-glossary#gloss-close-project|Close Project or Phase]], [[90-glossary#gloss-lessons-learned|Lessons learned]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Agile  
**Definition.** Agile is a **way of working that values flexibility, fast feedback, and frequent delivery**.  
It’s not a process—it’s a mindset. Agile teams learn by doing, adjust as they go,  
and focus on giving the customer something useful sooner rather than perfect later.

> **Exam cue.** If the question talks about responding to change, working closely with stakeholders,  
or delivering value in short bursts—it’s pointing at Agile.  
You’ll see it in planning, scope, risk, and even stakeholder engagement.  
Agile means you don’t need to know everything on day one—you figure it out as you build.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-agile-manifesto|Agile Manifesto]], [[90-glossary#gloss-hybrid|Hybrid life cycle]], [[90-glossary#gloss-incremental-delivery|Incremental delivery]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Agile Center of Excellence
#### ACoE

**Definition.** An Agile Center of Excellence is a group within the organization  
that supports consistent and effective use of Agile practices  
by providing coaching, tools, and shared knowledge.

> **Exam cue.** ACoEs are treated as **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)**  
that support consistency across teams and help scale Agile.  
On the exam, they often appear in adaptive governance or scaling contexts.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-organizational-process-assets|Organizational Process Assets]], [[90-glossary#gloss-hybrid|Hybrid (life cycle)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-agile|Agile mindset]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Agile Ceremonies  
**Definition.** Agile ceremonies are structured events  
used to synchronize, inspect, and adapt work.  
Examples include sprint planning, daily standups, reviews, and retrospectives.

> **Exam cue.** Know the purpose of each ceremony:  
**Planning** (what to do), **daily** (coordination), **review** (demo), **retro** (improve).  
Avoid cargo-cult Agile: ceremonies must serve outcomes like feedback and value flow.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-scrum-ceremonies|Scrum ceremonies]], [[90-glossary#gloss-agile|Agile]], [[90-glossary#gloss-iteration|Iteration]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Agile Mindset  
**Definition.** Agile is a mindset grounded in value delivery,  
collaboration, rapid feedback, and adaptive planning.  
It emphasizes individuals, working solutions, and responding to change.

> **Exam cue.** If a scenario is about change, feedback, value, or collaboration—  
Agile mindset fits. Don’t mistake Agile for just ceremonies (e.g., daily standups).  
The mindset comes first; practices serve outcomes.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-adaptive-life-cycle|Adaptive (life cycle)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-agile-ceremonies|Agile ceremonies]], [[90-glossary#gloss-scrum-ceremonies|Scrum ceremonies]]

[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Backlog  
**Definition.** A backlog is an ordered list of work items  
that represent future value to be delivered by the project or team.  
Backlogs are dynamic, evolving artifacts used in adaptive environments,  
often prioritized by customer value, risk, and learning.

> **Exam cue.** Backlogs are used in adaptive/hybrid life cycles.  
They are not frozen scope documents—they flex as feedback is received.  
Don’t treat the backlog like a predictive WBS or scope baseline.  
Near-term items are detailed, long-term items stay light until refined.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-adaptive-life-cycle|Adaptive (life cycle)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-iteration|Iteration]], [[90-glossary#gloss-scope-baseline|Scope baseline]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Backlog Refinement  
**Definition.** Backlog refinement is the ongoing process  
of reviewing, updating, and reordering backlog items  
to ensure near-term work is actionable, clear, and appropriately prioritized.

> **Exam cue.** Refinement reduces churn and uncertainty.  
It’s tied to progressive elaboration and just-in-time planning.  
Items that are too large or vague should be split or clarified.  
Expect exam cues around team prep, clarity, or iteration planning triggers.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-backlog|Backlog]], [[90-glossary#gloss-progressive-elaboration|Progressive elaboration]], [[90-glossary#gloss-iteration-planning|Iteration planning]]

[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Balanced Scorecard  
**Definition.** A balanced scorecard is a performance framework  
that tracks metrics across multiple perspectives—financial, customer,  
internal processes, and learning/growth—aligned to strategic goals.

> **Exam cue.** Use when exam questions ask for more than cost/schedule KPIs.  
The balanced scorecard offers a holistic view.  
Especially useful when governance or strategic alignment is emphasized.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-governance|Governance]], [[90-glossary#gloss-kpi|KPI]], [[90-glossary#gloss-business-value|Business value]]

---
### Baseline  
**Definition.** A baseline is the approved version of a plan  
used as a reference for comparison during project execution.  
Common baselines include scope, schedule, and cost.

> **Exam cue.** You need formal change control to modify a baseline.  
Avoid “informal” updates—these invalidate performance tracking.  
Variance is measured against the baseline, not a working draft.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-change-request|Change request]], [[90-glossary#gloss-scope-baseline|Scope baseline]], [[90-glossary#gloss-schedule-baseline|Schedule baseline]], [[90-glossary#gloss-cost-baseline|Cost baseline]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Basis of Estimates
#### BoE  
**Definition.** The basis of estimates documents how cost or duration estimates  
were developed—including assumptions, constraints, and data sources.

> **Exam cue.** Use BoE to support transparency, review, and risk analysis.  
If a question involves validating or justifying an estimate—BoE is your answer.  
Also helps during change control when explaining variances.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-bottom-up-estimating|Bottom-up estimating]], [[90-glossary#gloss-contingency|Contingency]], [[90-glossary#gloss-estimating-techniques|Estimating techniques]]

---
### Benchmarking  
**Definition.** Benchmarking compares practices or performance  
against industry standards or peers to identify improvement areas.

> **Exam cue.** Look for benchmarking in quality, estimating, or risk questions.  
PMI favors lessons learned + benchmarks before reinventing the wheel.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-opas|Organizational Process Assets (OPA)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-continuous-improvement|Continuous improvement]], [[90-glossary#gloss-historical-data|Historical data]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Benefit Cost Ratio
#### BCR
**Definition.** Benefit–cost ratio compares the expected benefits of a project  
to its expected costs. A BCR greater than 1 indicates a profitable investment.

> **Exam cue.** Financial decision tools often include BCR, NPV, IRR.  
Choose BCR when the question is about simple economic justification.  
Be cautious: BCR alone doesn’t ensure strategic alignment.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-business-case|Business case]], [[90-glossary#gloss-npv|Net Present Value (NPV)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-roi|ROI]]

---
### Benefits Management Plan  
**Definition.** The benefits management plan describes  
how and when the project's intended benefits will be realized and sustained.

> **Exam cue.** It supports **business value delivery**, not just project closure.  
Ownership of benefits may extend beyond the project life cycle.  
Tie this to business case and handoff responsibilities.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-benefits-realization|Benefits realization management]], [[90-glossary#gloss-business-value|Business value]], [[90-glossary#gloss-close-project|Close Project]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Benefits Owner  
**Definition.** The benefits owner is the person or role **accountable for realizing a specific benefit**  
defined in the business case or benefits management plan.  
They may come from the business unit, not the project team.

> **Exam cue.** Use this when PMI asks “Who ensures we actually get the value we planned for?”  
This is post-project accountability—not delivery, but realization.  
It appears in handoff, governance, and value-focused questions.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-benefits-realization|Benefits realization management]], [[90-glossary#gloss-business-case|Business case]], [[90-glossary#gloss-owner|Owner]]

---
### Benefits Realization Management  
**Definition.** Benefits realization management is the process  
of ensuring project outcomes deliver the intended benefits over time.

> **Exam cue.** Look for lifecycle language:  
**Plan → Deliver → Transition → Sustain.**  
Responsibilities may extend past the PM.  
Benefits tracking does not stop at go-live or handoff.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-benefits-management-plan|Benefits management plan]], [[90-glossary#gloss-business-value|Business value]], [[90-glossary#gloss-benefit-owner|Benefit owner]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]

### Beta Distribution  
**Definition.** The beta distribution is a **probability model**  
used in project estimation when the most likely outcome is weighted more heavily than the extremes.  
It reflects uncertainty while avoiding overly simplistic averages.

> **Exam cue.** Use this when the exam presents a three-point estimate using:  
(O + 4M + P) ÷ 6 — that’s a **beta-weighted** formula.  
Compared to triangular (simple average), beta provides a **more realistic forecast**.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-pert|PERT]], [[90-glossary#gloss-three-point-estimate|Three-point estimate]], [[90-glossary#gloss-estimate-activity-durations|Estimate Activity Durations]]
### Bid  
**Definition.** A bid is a seller’s **formal offer of price**  
for delivering goods or services under defined terms.  
It’s usually submitted in response to an RFQ (Request for Quotation) or RFP.

> **Exam cue.** Use “bid” when the question emphasizes **cost, competition**, or price-based vendor selection.  
This is common in **fixed-price contracts** or when selecting the lowest-cost option.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-proposal|Proposal]], [[90-glossary#gloss-source-selection-criteria|Source selection criteria]], [[90-glossary#gloss-contract-types|Contract types]]

---
### Bidder Conference  
**Definition.** A bidder conference is a meeting held with potential sellers  
to ensure clarity and fairness in the procurement process.

> **Exam cue.** Use bidder conferences to reduce ambiguity and ensure fairness.  
All answers and clarifications must be shared equally with all potential sellers.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-bid|Bid (proposal)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-rfp|Request for Proposal (RFP)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-procurement-management|Procurement management]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Blocker  
**Definition.** A blocker is an **immediate obstacle** that prevents a team member or the team  
from making forward progress on assigned work. It’s typically raised in daily standups and tracked for removal.

> **Exam cue.** If the question says “What’s stopping the team right now?”—this is a blocker.  
They’ve already happened and need quick resolution.  
Escalate if the team can’t remove it internally.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-impediment|Impediment]], [[90-glossary#gloss-servant-leadership|Servant leadership]], [[90-glossary#gloss-daily-standup|Daily standup]]

---
### Bottom-up Estimating  
**Definition.** Bottom-up estimating builds estimates  
from the lowest-level components and aggregates them up to the whole.

> **Exam cue.** Most accurate, most time-consuming.  
Use when scope is well defined and detail is available.  
Combine with **basis of estimates** for traceability.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-estimating-techniques|Estimating techniques]], [[90-glossary#gloss-wbs|WBS]], [[90-glossary#gloss-contingency|Contingency]]

---
### Buffer
**Definition.** A buffer is additional time inserted into the schedule  
to account for uncertainty or risk. Often used in critical chain method.

> **Exam cue.** Don’t confuse **buffers** with contingency or float.  
Buffers protect the critical chain; float is what’s available between dependent tasks.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-critical-chain|Critical chain method]], [[90-glossary#gloss-contingency|Contingency]], [[90-glossary#gloss-schedule-compression|Schedule compression]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Burndown Chart  
**Definition.** A burndown chart shows the remaining work  
versus time in an iteration or release cycle.

> **Exam cue.** Falling line = progress.  
Flat or rising = scope creep or underperformance.  
PMI prefers visual tools like these in adaptive questions.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-sprint|Sprint]], [[90-glossary#gloss-velocity|Velocity]], [[90-glossary#gloss-information-radiator|Information radiator]]

---
### Burnup Chart  
**Definition.** A burnup chart shows completed work  
against the total scope, making both progress and scope change visible.

> **Exam cue.** Use when stakeholders need to see scope change  
alongside progress. Clearer than burndown when scope expands mid-project.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-sprint|Sprint]], [[90-glossary#gloss-velocity|Velocity]], [[90-glossary#gloss-scope-creep|Scope creep]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Business Case  
**Definition.** The business case explains the justification for the project—  
its strategic fit, costs, options, and expected benefits.

> **Exam cue.** If assumptions break down,  
you revisit the business case before plowing ahead.  
Tie it to go/no-go decisions, governance, and alignment.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-benefits-management-plan|Benefits management plan]], [[90-glossary#gloss-justification|Justification]], [[90-glossary#gloss-benefit-owner|Benefit owner]]

---
### Business Value  
**Definition.** Business value is the net benefit realized  
by stakeholders from the outcomes delivered by a project.

> **Exam cue.** Not all value is financial—  
compliance, satisfaction, and risk reduction also count.  
PMI stresses early and sustained value delivery across the life cycle.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-benefits-realization|Benefits realization management]], [[90-glossary#gloss-strategic-alignment|Strategic alignment]], [[90-glossary#gloss-benefits-management-plan|Benefits management plan]]

---
### Buyer
(vs seller)  
**Definition.** The buyer is the party acquiring goods or services via contract;  
the seller is the party delivering them.

> **Exam cue.** Know your role in procurement questions.  
Buyers write the SOW, evaluate bids, and manage contracts.  
Ethical behavior and fairness matter.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-procurement-management|Procurement management]], [[90-glossary#gloss-sow|Statement of Work (SOW)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-contract-types|Contract types]]

### Cause And Effect Diagram  
**Definition.** A cause-and-effect diagram, also known as a fishbone or Ishikawa diagram,  
is a visual tool used to identify and group possible root causes of a problem.  
It helps categorize factors like materials, methods, people, and environment  
to support root cause analysis and quality improvement.

> **Exam cue.** Use this in **Control Quality** or **Manage Quality** questions  
that involve identifying why a defect or issue occurred.  
It does not solve the problem—it frames it for investigation.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-control-quality|Control Quality]], [[90-glossary#gloss-quality-tools|Quality tools]], [[90-glossary#gloss-root-cause-analysis|Root cause analysis]]

---
### Change Control Board
#### CCB  
**Definition.** A Change Control Board (CCB) is a formally chartered group  
that reviews, evaluates, approves, defers, or rejects change requests  
to the project, including changes to baselines, deliverables, or processes.

> **Exam cue.** When questions involve **approval of scope, schedule, or cost changes**,  
the CCB is the authority. If governance is involved or change thresholds are exceeded,  
you escalate to the CCB.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-change-request|Change request]], [[90-glossary#gloss-integrated-change-control|Integrated Change Control]], [[90-glossary#gloss-governance|Governance]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Change Log  
**Definition.** The change log is a project document  
that records all change requests and their status—approved, rejected, or pending.  
It also includes dates, decisions, and implementation notes.

> **Exam cue.** Use the **change log** to track and communicate  
the lifecycle of all submitted change requests.  
It is updated as part of **Monitor and Control Project Work**.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-change-request|Change request]], [[90-glossary#gloss-project-documents|Project documents]], [[90-glossary#gloss-monitor-control|Monitor and Control Project Work]]

---
### Change Request  
**Definition.** A change request is a formal proposal  
to modify any project document, deliverable, baseline, or component.  
It can include corrective, preventive, or defect repair actions.

> **Exam cue.** All change requests go through **Integrated Change Control**  
in a predictive environment. In agile, change may be built into backlog reprioritization.  
On the exam, look for formal triggers (variance, issue, risk) before choosing a change.

---
### Control Limits  
**Definition.** Control limits are thresholds used in quality control charts  
to indicate when a process is statistically out of control.  
They are typically ±3 sigma from the mean.

> **Exam cue.** If a question describes a chart with an upper and lower limit  
and a point outside those lines, it's likely a **control chart** scenario.  
Exceeding control limits = unstable process → corrective action.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-quality-control|Quality control]], [[90-glossary#gloss-process-behavior-chart|Process behavior chart]], [[90-glossary#gloss-control-quality|Control Quality]]

### Control Scope  
**Definition.** Control Scope is the process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope  
and managing changes to the scope baseline.

> **Exam cue.** When asked about **preventing scope creep**,  
Control Scope is the correct answer.  
It ensures that only approved changes are implemented and aligns actual work to the plan.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-validate-scope|Validate Scope]], [[90-glossary#gloss-scope-baseline|Scope baseline]], [[90-glossary#gloss-change-request|Change request]]

---
### Cost Baseline  
**Definition.** The cost baseline is the approved version of the project budget,  
exclusive of management reserves, used to measure, monitor, and control cost performance.

> **Exam cue.** This is the reference point for calculating variances  
like **CV** and **CPI**. If the question involves earned value math  
or how much budget was planned, you’re working against the cost baseline.

**Related:**

### Cost of Quality
#### CoQ  
**Definition.** Cost of Quality is the total cost to ensure product quality,  
including prevention, appraisal, and failure costs (internal and external).

> **Exam cue.** Know the four categories:  
- **Prevention**: training, process design  
- **Appraisal**: inspections, testing  
- **Internal failure**: rework, scrap  
- **External failure**: warranty, liability  
More prevention = lower failure cost.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-control-quality|Control Quality]], [[90-glossary#gloss-manage-quality|Manage Quality]], [[90-glossary#gloss-quality-metrics|Quality metrics]]

---
### Cost Performance Index
#### CPI
**Definition.** CPI is an earned value metric that measures cost efficiency  
by comparing earned value (EV) to actual cost (AC):  
**CPI = EV ÷ AC**. A CPI < 1 means over budget.

> **Exam cue.** This is the go-to cost metric in earned value questions.  
Use it to forecast future performance and justify corrective action  
when budgets are off track.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-earned-value-management|Earned Value Management (EVM)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-cost-variance|Cost variance (CV)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-eac|Estimate at Completion (EAC)]]

---
[[#Glossary|Top]]
### Cost Variance
#### CV  
**Definition.** Cost variance is the difference between earned value (EV) and actual cost (AC):  
**CV = EV – AC**. A negative CV means the project is over budget.

> **Exam cue.** If a question asks “How far over/under budget are we?”  
this is the metric to use. Unlike CPI, CV is expressed in currency,  
not as a ratio. Track it as part of **Control Costs**.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-cpi|Cost performance index (CPI)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-earned-value|Earned value]], [[90-glossary#gloss-control-costs|Control Costs (process)]]

---
### Crashing  
**Definition.** Crashing is a schedule compression technique  
that shortens the schedule duration by adding resources to critical path activities—usually at higher cost.

> **Exam cue.** Use crashing when time is more important than cost,  
and scope remains unchanged.  
Not all tasks can be crashed—only those on the **critical path**.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-schedule-compression|Schedule compression]], [[90-glossary#gloss-critical-path|Critical path]], [[90-glossary#gloss-fast-tracking|Fast tracking]]

---
### Critical Chain Method  
**Definition.** The critical chain method is a schedule technique  
that focuses on resource availability and buffers rather than just task logic.  
It accounts for limited resources and inserts buffer time to protect delivery.

> **Exam cue.** If the question mentions **resource constraints**,  
**buffers**, or **late starts**, this method applies.  
It differs from the critical path by focusing on resources, not just sequence.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-critical-path|Critical path]], [[90-glossary#gloss-buffer|Buffer (schedule)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-resource-optimization|Resource optimization]]

---
### Critical Path  
**Definition.** The critical path is the longest sequence of activities  
that determines the shortest possible duration for the project.  
Any delay on the critical path delays the whole project.

> **Exam cue.** Watch for zero float.  
Exam questions may ask for the impact of delay, or how to compress time.  
Use in **Schedule Network Analysis** and **Critical Path Method** questions.

### Defect  
**Definition.** A defect is a nonconformance to requirements,  
specifications, or expectations—usually discovered during quality control.  
It may be internal or external and requires correction or acceptance per agreement.

> **Exam cue.** Use “defect” in **Control Quality** questions  
when deliverables don’t meet specifications.  
Resolution may involve **defect repair**, a **change request**,  
or documented acceptance of the deviation.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-defect-repair|Defect repair]], [[90-glossary#gloss-control-quality|Control Quality]], [[90-glossary#gloss-validate-scope|Validate Scope]]

---
### Defect Repair  
**Definition.** Defect repair is an intentional activity  
to correct a nonconforming product or component  
so that it meets agreed-upon requirements.

> **Exam cue.** If something fails inspection,  
defect repair is often initiated via a **change request**.  
This is a reactive response—distinct from prevention.

**Related:**  
[[90-glossary#gloss-corrective-action|Corrective action]], [[90-glossary#gloss-change-request|Change request]], [[90-glossary#gloss-control-quality|Control Quality]]

### Organizational Breakdown Structure
(OBS)  
**Definition.** The OBS maps the project’s work to the performing organization’s hierarchy.  
It shows which departments or units are responsible for specific WBS elements  
and helps connect accountability to deliverables.

> **Exam cue.** If the question references aligning work with departments,  
reporting structure, or assigning accountability across teams,  
this is the right tool. Don’t confuse the OBS with the WBS—  
the WBS breaks down work, the OBS assigns it.  
Often used in **resource planning**, **cost accounting**, or **control account assignment**.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-wbs|Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-responsibility-assignment-matrix|Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-control-account|Control account]]

### Organizational Process Assets
(OPAs)  
**Definition.** OPAs are internal assets like templates, procedures,  
historical information, and knowledge bases used to plan and execute the project.  
They’re unique to each organization and available to the project team.

> **Exam cue.** When asked “what input helps define how to do the work?”—  
this is the answer.  
Unlike EEFs, OPAs are **within your control** and should be tailored and reused.  
They are inputs to nearly every planning process, especially early on.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-eefs|Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)]], [[90-glossary#gloss-lessons-learned-register|Lessons learned register]], [[90-glossary#gloss-knowledge-repository|Knowledge repository]]

### Organizational Structure 
**Definition.** Organizational structure defines how roles, responsibilities,  
and reporting lines are arranged. PMI highlights **functional**, **matrix** (weak/balanced/strong),  
and **projectized** as key types, each affecting the PM’s authority and resource control.

> **Exam cue.** If the question is about reporting, decision authority,  
or how resources are assigned, this is the term.  
Expect matrix to be the most tested.  
Remember: Functional = low PM power; Projectized = high; Matrix = in between.

### Output  
**Definition.** An output is any tangible or intangible result  
produced by a process. It could be a document, decision, deliverable, update, or plan.  
Outputs are tracked, baselined, and used to control progress.

> **Exam cue.** Watch for questions about **process results**.  
If it asks “What comes out of this process?”—you’re looking for an output.  
Be ready to distinguish between outputs (created during the process)  
and deliverables (what the customer receives). Not every output is a deliverable.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-deliverable|Deliverable]], [[90-glossary#gloss-performance-reports|Performance reports]], [[90-glossary#gloss-project-management-plan|Project Management Plan]]

---
### Over Allocation  
**Definition.** Over-allocation occurs when a resource is assigned  to more tasks than they can complete in the available time.  It results in schedule slippage, burnout risk, and quality issues if not addressed.

> **Exam cue.** When the exam presents a resource scheduled on multiple tasks at once,  
or a delay caused by resource unavailability—this is your red flag.  
PMI expects the PM to resolve this by applying **resource leveling**,  
negotiating trade-offs, or adjusting the schedule.  
It often shows up in **resource management** or **schedule compression** scenarios.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-resource-optimization|Resource optimization]], [[90-glossary#gloss-resource-leveling|Resource leveling]], [[90-glossary#gloss-schedule-variance|Schedule variance]]

---
### Overlapping Phases  
**Definition.** Overlapping phases occur when **a subsequent phase begins before the prior one is fully complete**. This is a form of **fast tracking**—a schedule compression technique used to shorten timelines by performing activities in parallel rather than in sequence.

> **Exam cue.** Use this when the exam talks about “starting work early” or “reducing schedule length.”  
Overlapping phases = faster delivery, but with **higher risk** and tighter coordination.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-fast-tracking|Fast tracking]], [[90-glossary#gloss-schedule-compression|Schedule compression]], [[90-glossary#gloss-sequential-phases|Sequential phases]]

---
### Owner  
**Definition.** An owner is the **person or role accountable** for making sure something specific gets done—  
whether it's a requirement, risk, benefit, or deliverable. Ownership implies accountability and active tracking.

> **Exam cue.** If the question says “Who’s responsible for this being completed, not just worked on?”—that’s the owner.  
PMI assigns owners to risks, requirements, and benefits—not just tasks.

### Probability Impact Matrix 
#### PIM
**Definition.** The P-I matrix is a qualitative risk tool  
used to prioritize risks by rating their probability and impact on a grid.  
Each cell shows how risks of different severity and likelihood are ranked.

> **Exam cue.** Use this when the exam asks for risk **prioritization**,  
**heat mapping**, or whether a risk is **low/medium/high**.  
This is not a numeric tool—it’s about judgment, not math.  
Appears in **Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis**.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-risk-register|Risk register]], [[90-glossary#gloss-risk-owners|Risk owners]], [[90-glossary#gloss-perform-qualitative-risk-analysis|Qualitative risk analysis]]

that pulls together all subsidiary management plans (scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, etc.)  
into a single source of truth for execution, monitoring, and control.

> **Exam cue.** If the question says “the plan” without specifying which one—assume it means **this**.  
It’s the go-to reference for baselines, authority, change control, and tracking.  
When in doubt—this is the big one that answers, “Are we still on plan?”

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-management-plan|Management plan]], [[90-glossary#gloss-change-request|Change request]], [[90-glossary#gloss-integrated-change-control|Integrated Change Control]]

### Proposal  
**Definition.** A proposal is a **detailed response from a seller**  
that describes how they will meet the buyer’s needs—including approach, schedule, team, risk management, and price.

> **Exam cue.** Choose this when the question talks about **vendor qualifications**,  
technical solutions, or scoring methods.  
It’s more than just a bid—it’s the full plan.

### Pull Communication
#### Pull

**Definition.** Pull communication makes information available  
so stakeholders can retrieve it when needed.  
It’s used when the audience is large or the data is non-critical.

> **Exam cue.** Choose **pull** when the question involves wikis, dashboards,  
shared folders, or knowledge repositories.  
This is passive—no message is sent.  
Ideal for reference material or audit trails, not urgent updates.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-knowledge-repository|Knowledge repository]], [[90-glossary#gloss-communications-management|Communications management plan]], [[90-glossary#gloss-documentation|Documentation]]

### Quality  
**Definition.** Quality is the degree to which a deliverable meets  
**requirements**, **standards**, and **stakeholder expectations**.  
It’s not about perfection—it’s about **fitness for use** and consistency.

> **Exam cue.** If the exam asks how to confirm the output is good enough—this is the concept.  
Quality = conformance to requirements.  
Don’t confuse internal verification (Control Quality) with customer acceptance (Validate Scope).  
PMI treats quality as both a **process** and a **result**.

**Definition.** Release planning maps out when product increments  
or features will be delivered over time. It sets delivery cadence,  
aligns team and stakeholder expectations, and supports value delivery.

> **Exam cue.** When the exam asks “How do you plan multiple deliveries over time?”  
or “How do stakeholders know when to expect updates?”—this is your tool.  
Common in Agile and hybrid life cycles.  
Focuses on **value drops**, not just calendar dates.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-product-backlog|Product backlog]], [[90-glossary#gloss-incremental-delivery|Incremental delivery]], [[90-glossary#gloss-mvp|Minimum Viable Product (MVP)]]

---
### Resource  
**Definition:** A resource is **anything you use to get the project done**—people, equipment, materials, tools, facilities, even time.  
Resources can be physical (like laptops) or human (like a developer or sponsor).  
If you need it to deliver work, it’s a resource.

> **Exam cue.** If the question is about assigning, acquiring, leveling, or overloading something—you're dealing with resources.  
PMI might frame it as “Which resource is required?” or “What’s the constraint?”  
Also appears in scheduling (calendars), team building, and conflict resolution questions.

of the project schedule, including start and finish dates,  
used to compare actual performance to the planned timeline.

> **Exam cue.** If a question asks, “what are we measuring schedule variance against?”  
—this is your term.  
Once approved, the schedule baseline is frozen and only changed through formal change control.  
Used for tracking delays, forecasting, and performance reporting.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-baseline|Baseline]], [[90-glossary#gloss-schedule-variance|Schedule variance]], [[90-glossary#gloss-project-management-plan|Project Management Plan]]

---
### Schedule Compression  
**(fast-tracking, crashing)**  
**Definition.** Schedule compression shortens the timeline  
without changing scope by overlapping tasks (**fast-tracking**)  
or adding resources (**crashing**).

> **Exam cue.** If the exam asks how to recover from a delay,  
meet a deadline, or deliver earlier—choose a compression strategy.

It is a foundational technique in Agile to enforce focus, limit waste, and protect team capacity.

> **Exam cue.** PMI expects you to recognize timeboxing in **Sprint Planning**, daily scrums, demos, and retrospectives.  
If the question involves “doing as much as possible in a set time”—this is it.  
Don’t confuse timeboxes (fixed duration) with deadlines (fixed dates).

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-sprint|Sprint]], [[90-glossary#gloss-scrum-ceremonies|Scrum ceremonies]], [[90-glossary#gloss-incremental-delivery|Incremental delivery]]

---
### Tolerance  
**(governance)**  
**Definition.** Tolerance defines the **acceptable range of variation**  
for a given performance measure—like cost, time, or scope—before action is required.  
It’s a built-in buffer for decision-making.

> **Exam cue.** If the question asks “when do we escalate?”  
or describes a performance deviation that might still be OK—this is your term.  
PMI frames tolerance as **internal governance**, not slack.  
Exceed it, and you're out of bounds; stay within it, and the team proceeds without approval.

**Related:** [[90-glossary#gloss-threshold|Threshold]], [[90-glossary#gloss-governance|Governance]], [[90-glossary#gloss-monitor-control|Monitor and Control Project Work]]

### Value Delivery  
**Definition.** Value delivery is about achieving outcomes  
that **matter to the business and stakeholders**—not just completing work.  
It focuses on benefits, usability, and strategic alignment.

> **Exam cue.** If the question mentions **why** the project matters,  
or how to ensure the work actually helps someone—this is your lens.  
PMI has shifted hard toward value delivery as the central role of a PM.  
Delivery without value = failure.
