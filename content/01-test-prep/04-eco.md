*Your Guide to PMP Exam Domains and Thinking Framework*

## What this page is about  

This page breaks down the **PMI Exam Content Outline (ECO)** — the official blueprint used by PMI to structure the PMP® exam. While the *PMBOK® Guide* explains what project management is, the ECO defines how it will be tested.

The ECO organizes the exam around **three performance domains**: *People*, *Process*, and *Business Environment*. Each domain contains **tasks**, which describe responsibilities of project managers, and **enablers**, which illustrate how those tasks show up in practice.

Understanding the ECO helps you:
- Know what PMI expects you to *do* as a project manager  
- Recognize the logic behind situational questions  
- Build confidence for exam scenarios  

For definitions of terms used on this page, refer to the [[3-glossary|Glossary]].

## Applying Project Management Principles in Practice  

The ECO is principle-informed — it doesn't test memorization of the PMBOK. Instead, it expects you to apply **PMI's 12 Project Management Principles** in the context of real-world work.

Here’s how PMI’s domains map back to the principles:

| ECO Domain           | Principle Focus Examples                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| People               | Collaboration, Leadership, Stewardship, Adaptability             |
| Process              | Quality, Risk, Tailoring, Value Focus                            |
| Business Environment | Stewardship, Value Delivery, Change Enablement, Systems Thinking |

### Scenario Example:  
> You’re leading a cross-functional team with remote members. A team member frequently misses stand-ups and deliverables. What should you do?

Principles at play:  
- Foster collaboration and shared understanding (People)  
- Adapt leadership to context and support team performance (People)  
- Resolve issues constructively using [[3-glossary#Emotional intelligence|Emotional intelligence]] (People)  

Best answer: Engage directly, clarify expectations, and coach the team member while maintaining transparency with the team.

## How the ECO Drives the Exam  

- Every PMP exam question is tied to a **task and enabler** from the ECO.  
- Most questions are **situational** — testing your judgment, not rote memory.  
- The exam integrates [[3-glossary#Agile|Agile]], [[3-glossary#Adaptive|Adaptive]], and [[3-glossary#Predictive|Predictive]] concepts across all domains.  
- You won’t see questions labeled by domain — PMI blends them seamlessly.

### Examples of Enabler Logic  
**Task: Assess and manage [[3-glossary#Risk|Risk]]**  
Enablers may involve:  
- Anticipating risk triggers  
- Using a [[3-glossary#Risk register|Risk register]]  
- Communicating risks proactively  

**Task: Lead a team**  
Enablers may involve:  
- Resolving conflict constructively  
- Promoting team [[3-glossary#Empowerment|Empowerment]]  
- Supporting decision-making

## Using the ECO to Guide Study Strategy  

To optimize your exam prep:

- **Start with the domains** — understand what PMI expects you to *do*.  
- **Use tasks and enablers** as behavior-based goals in your studies.  
- **Connect each domain** back to [[01-test-prep/03-principles.md|Project management principles]].  
- Use ECO-based mock questions that test *how you think*, not just what you know.  
- Review the ECO regularly — it’s your mental checklist on exam day.

- For question practice that mirrors the ECO framework, we recommend [PMI StudyHall](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certification-resources/pmi-study-hall?utm_source_misc=examsimulator_PMP)
