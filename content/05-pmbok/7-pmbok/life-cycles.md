# Life Cycles

PMBOK 7 describes **life cycles** as the delivery patterns a project or product follows from start to finish. These cycles define *how work is performed over time*. Types include **predictive** (sequential, scope fixed early), **adaptive** (iterative, flexible scope), and **hybrid** (a tailored mix). A **product life cycle** may even extend beyond the project into operations and retirement.  

⚠️ This is not the same as the **Project Management Life Cycle** (the five process groups from PMBOK 6). The project management life cycle explains the *management work*—initiating through closing—that applies universally. By contrast, life cycles in PMBOK 7 show the *delivery approach* chosen based on context, uncertainty, and stakeholder needs.  

This placeholder confirms the link is active. Future content will expand with examples, comparisons, and exam cues for distinguishing cycles correctly.
