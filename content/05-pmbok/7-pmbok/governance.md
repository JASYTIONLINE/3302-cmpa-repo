# Governance

Governance in PMBOK 7 refers to the frameworks, roles, and processes that define **who has authority to make decisions, how oversight is exercised, and what boundaries shape project behavior**. It ensures alignment between organizational strategy and project outcomes by clarifying decision rights, escalation paths, and compliance requirements.  

Good governance provides accountability while still allowing flexibility. It determines how changes are approved, how performance is monitored, and how risk is managed across the portfolio. In PMBOK 7, governance is considered a contextual factor that interacts with tailoring and value delivery, rather than a checklist of processes.  

For exam prep, governance cues often appear in scenarios about authority, compliance, or reporting lines.  

This placeholder ensures the link is functional. A complete version will expand on governance models, contrast PMBOK 6 and 7 perspectives, and provide examples of decision boundaries in real projects.
