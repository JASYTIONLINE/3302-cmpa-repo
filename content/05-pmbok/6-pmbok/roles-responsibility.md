# Roles and Responsibilities

Roles and responsibilities define who does what within a project, ensuring clarity, accountability, and alignment with objectives. A **role** is the function performed (such as project manager, sponsor, or team member), while a **responsibility** describes the specific tasks or deliverables expected of that role. Clearly documenting both prevents gaps, overlaps, or confusion during execution.  

Tools like a **RACI chart** (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) help visualize and communicate these assignments across stakeholders. In PMBOK guidance, defining roles and responsibilities is part of resource planning and team development, connecting directly to success in scope, schedule, and cost performance.  

This placeholder page reassures readers that the link is live and provides a framework for future content. Later expansions will include examples of key project roles, PMBOK 6 vs. PMBOK 7 perspectives, and guidance on tailoring responsibility assignments in different organizational structures.
